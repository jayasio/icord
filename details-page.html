              <p>Ramchandra Alias Ameet Chate (Research Resource Centre, Visvesvaraya Technological University,
                Belagavi,Karnataka) and Dr. Shankargouda Bharamanaikar (VisvesvarayaTechnological University, Belagavi,
                Karnataka (India))</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the modern era of marketing, creating pleasurable experiences by enhancing store
                atmospherics, which we coin as ambience, has emerged as a deciding factor for profitability of firms.
                Hence,
                retailers have been investing a lot to create positive experiences and identifying the factors that
                stimulate
                the conative, affective and cognitive factors.<br />Current increased usage in Information and
                Communication
                Technology, free knowledge sources have made the consumer more aware of substitutes and better options
                at better
                prices. Hence studying the impact of store atmospherics, which include lighting, visual merchandising,
                Color
                that stimulates positive experiences have been studied to increase the profitability of retailers and
                improve
                customer experiences from user’s perspective.<br />The study undertaken will help to understand the
                dimension in
                designing the store atmospherics, which are most effective in attracting, the customers and affecting
                their
                conative, cognitive and affective replies. This study is based on the user’s experience in buying the
                product
                and evaluating the factors that stimulate the buying intention through the usability audit. The findings
                of this
                investigation will help the retailers to develop better in store atmospherics, helpful in increasing the
                sales
                and consumer loyalty that contribute to the profitability.</p>

              <p><b>The impact of culture on design versus design on culture</b></p>
              <p>Lau Langeveld (Delft University of Technology) and Amarendra Kumar Das (IIT Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The effect is not reversible from culture to design, and from design to culture, both
                directions
                have different parameters to reach the goal of “The Impact”. The significance of culture and design must
                first
                be investigated, regardless of the impact. Then identify the influencing factors for achieving an
                effective
                result. The influencing factors are arranged in the order of importance.<br />Culture versus Design
                shows the
                difference in manifestation. Culture is about what happens in society and Design is about realising the
                things
                that meet people's needs.<br />The literature study must provide validation of the influence factors.
                These are
                studied and explained in two different cases: 1.a. A design from India that has changed the behaviour of
                the
                Indian. 1.b. A cultural change in a part of India that has changed society. 2.a. A design from the
                Netherlands
                that has changed people's behaviour. 2.b. A cultural change by stopping gas exploration in the
                Netherlands.<br />The two case studies will give insight into the impact of Design and Culture, but also
                the
                difference between the Dutch and Indian Culture. The use of the next description of culture and design
                must
                belong to the case studies.<br />Culture is a common characteristic of a group or category of people who
                differ
                from each other. The culture of a particular profession can, therefore, described with the distinctive
                features
                of that profession. Change of aggregation level means changes in the concept of culture. For example,
                children
                receive a cultural anchor from home that differs from the professional culture taught at school or the
                workplace. Culture is the most complicated concept, but it is a compound word with its many meanings.
                But
                everyone within a group forms a community that lives, works and celebrates within the theoretical
                concept of
                culture. Culture as a concept encompasses a large number of knowledge areas in our digital age:
                education,
                learning, social, economic, industrial production, organisation, politics, religion, art, lifestyle,
                habits,
                etc. Here only the knowledge that is more closely related to the design directly or indirectly is
                considered.<br />Design is a creative process for solving problems of economic, social and cultural
                issues. A
                design process goes through many paths that are laid down in a large number of methods, sequential,
                linear,
                circular, spiral, waterfall, etc. The common goal is to create or search for a solution. Creating a
                solution is
                often carried out by a designer and searching for an answer is usually carried out by technocrats. The
                designer
                is allowed to fully deepen his creative skills within limits to achieve a result that enriches the
                community.
                The technocrats are looking for solutions that can be a new combination of partial solutions; the
                combinatorial
                power plays an essential role in this.<br />Design of a material object consists of observable elements
                and
                principles and contributes to the cultural identity of its environment. But a non-material object has no
                physical expression. Still, the elements and principles are based on audio, visual, thoughts, taste and
                smell.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Usage of smartphones and tablet devices have been increasing rapidly with multi-touch
                interaction and powerful configurations. Performing tasks on mobile phones becomes more complex as
                people age
                thereby increasing their cognitive load. In this context, we conducted an eye-tracking study with 50
                participants between the age of 20 to 60 years and above who are living in Bangalore, India. The study
                aims to
                investigate how ageing affects user experience on mobile phones while performing complex tasks. The
                study
                focuses on estimating cognitive load of participants while performing tasks on mobile phones using eye
                tracking
                metrics. The study consists of five tasks to be performed on an android phone under naturalistic
                scenarios by
                each participant, wearing eye tracking glasses. We recorded fixation rate, saccadic rate, average
                fixation
                duration, maximum fixation duration and standard deviation of pupil dilation for left and right eyes
                respectively for each participant. Results from our study show that ageing affects user experience on
                mobile
                phones while performing complex tasks. We noted that, participants aged between 50 to 60+ years had
                difficulties
                in completing tasks and showed increased cognitive workload. We also noted that participants took longer
                fixation duration to complete tasks which involved copy-paste operations. Additionally, we aim to
                identify
                design implications and provide design recommendations for designers and manufacturers.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This paper proposes a set of techniques to investigate eye gaze and fixation patterns
                while
                users interact with electronic user interfaces. In particular, two case studies are presented - one on
                analyzing
                eye gaze while interacting with deceptive materials in web pages and another on analyzing graphs in
                standard
                computer monitor and virtu-al reality displays. We analyzed spatial and temporal distributions of eye
                gaze
                fixa-tions and sequence of eye gaze movements. We used this information to propose new design guidelines
                to
                avoid deceptive materials in web and user-friendly repre-sentation of data in 2D graphs. In 2D graph
                study we
                identified that area graph has lowest number of clusters for user's gaze fixations and lowest average
                response
                time. The results of 2D graph study was implemented in virtual and mixed reality environment. Along with
                this,
                it was observed that the duration while interacting with deceptive materials in web pages is independent
                of the
                number of fixations. Furthermore, web-based data visualization tool for analyzing eye tracking data from
                single
                and multiple users was developed.</p>

              <p>Vishaka Agarwal (National Institute of Fashion Technology, (Min.of Textiles,Govt of India),Bhopal)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Fashion is a fast changing phenomenon and looking at the current state of world, the
                future
                fashion would have very different dimension in terms of material used to give shape to fashion products.
                Also
                Fashion would find spaces in various unexplored avenues to make the consumer feel more comfortable. More
                Eco-friendly sustainable raw materials and methods of production needs to be adopted to put a check on
                fast
                depleting resource of Earth which would leave reduced amount of carbon footprints on the Earth's
                surface.
                Recycling, Reuse and Redesign of materials to produce new fashionable products which are Eco-Adaptable
                needs to
                be designed. Materials generated out of natural waste needs to be developed. Frugal innovation would be
                the key
                element to be considered.<br />Design would be visible in every sphere of life not only restricted to
                Garments
                and lifestyle living accessories, but in many more avenues of communication and commutation which are
                the key
                aspects of life with elements of sustainability incorporated. The ways of dressing and lifestyle living
                would
                undergo sea-change in the coming next few decades.<br />Therefore, the Fashion fraternity has to look at
                things
                in wider perspective and Design institutions have to prepare curriculum looking at the wider perspective
                of
                future fashion needs which requires the future fashion professionals to have multi-dimensional talent
                and
                knowledge of \"Everything and Everywhere\" to meet the future fast changing requirement of co-existence
                of
                \"Environment and Life\" on Earth. Looking at this wider perspective of future needs Professionals,
                technologists and Academicians associated with Fashion design and technology would be interviewed to
                understand
                the pedagogy and strategy which needs to be innovated in Fashion education to be looked for Future
                Fashion .</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The additively manufacturable products are emerging as a part of modern product
                revolution and
                innovation. This paper discusses the application of bio-inspired design in making the additively
                manufacturable
                spin coater as a case study. As a part of this, the method called multi-inspirational design for
                additive
                manufacturing (MiDAM) is proposed. The application of method resulted in the additively manufacturable,
                low cost
                and affordable spin coater, with scope for tuneable resonance vibration just by varying the dimensional
                and
                material parameters. The possibility for installing the dampers in the designed form contribute to
                better
                vibration isolation, still maintaining the aesthetic appearance. Further, the work shows the possibility
                of
                exploiting the bio-inspired design to support additive manufacturing of different products.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In previous work, the so-called role-based prototyping approach (RBPA) was proposed.
                It is for
                interdisciplinary student teams and puts strong emphasis on autonomy and proactivity. Progress in the
                project is
                measured by the three lenses of human-centered design, feasibility, viability, and desirability. It
                guides the
                students on important aspects of fuzzy-front product development by providing a template of the overall
                process
                and specific tools, e.g., an adapted kanban board. This approach was limited to academia. In this paper,
                an
                application of the RBPA in an industry setting is discussed. Industry settings are different from
                classical
                fuzzy-front end scenarios because a context is given. To address this, the roles of the proposed
                approach were
                refined by assigning specific tasks to incorporate customer requirements. The result was deployed in a
                university course where students were given design tasks from industry. Each team is guided through this
                process
                with the help of daily coaching sessions and their progress is tracked, recorded, and evaluated. The
                results are
                then discussed in detail with an outlook for the future.</p>

              <p><b>Capturing knowledge transfer using Zachman framework in bioinspired design process</b></p>
              <p>Sunil Sharma (lovely professional university) and Prabir Sarkar (IIT Ropar)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Natural entities are source of inspiration for designers as they exhibit nature’s
                strategies
                that are unique and novel. Many products have been designed in past using bioinspired design process.
                For
                understanding and absing principles from nature, the knowledge of biological entity is a must. Knowledge
                capture
                and representation for bioinspired de-sign is complex process. Firstly, the biological entities are
                documented
                in different places such as books, articles, blogs etc. A designer might need to spend considerable time
                while
                shuffling through these documents without coming to any conclusion. Secondly, biological knowledge is
                complex
                and from different domain. This complexity at the entity level as well as the retrieving captured
                knowledge can
                lead to confusion and frustration. Thirdly, the roles of different stakeholders are not clearly defined.
                Hence,
                the knowledge collection, compilation, usage and representation process is not clearly defined. We,
                hereby,
                provide an organizational approach to represent bioinspired design knowledge collection, compilation,
                and usage
                and representation process using Zachman framework. Zachman framework provides the descriptive
                representation of
                enterprise architecture, uses 6 primitives and can handle complex systems. In this research, we
                understand and
                apply Zachman framework to capture and represent bioinspired design knowledge with an organizational
                viewpoint.
                The goal of this research is to organize and represent captured knowledge transfer, building and
                representing
                process and make it readily available for designers who can use it to make design decisions.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The Indian government and private health sector in India have neglected nurses.
                India’s public
                health expenditure remains bleak at 1.4% of GDP that is lower than many lower income countries . India
                is the
                second most populous nation in the world, with 17.5 per cent of the global population (Census of India,
                2011).<br />India stands at 75th rank among around 133 developing countries with respect of number of
                nurses;
                India has only 1.4 nurses available per thousand population. The country needs an additional 2.4 million
                nurses
                as on 2019. Despite being a major supplier of the health work force to the world, the health care
                industry of
                India is suffering a wide gap .<br />Poor infrastructure, lack of quality control of academic
                curriculum,
                paucity of qualified trainers and geographical imbalance of nursing institutes across the country has
                led to an
                alarming situation. To overcome the dismal working and social conditions have also triggered off
                large-scale
                migration to high-income nations of Indian nurses further exacerbating the nursing shortages in the
                country . A
                significant percentage of senior nurses from the existing workforce are due to retire taking with them
                years of
                invaluable experiential knowledge thus the brain drain worsening the existing dire
                situation.<br />According to
                Indian Nursing Council there are total of 8,770 nursing institutes across India supplying 0.27 million
                nursing
                graduates to the healthcare industry annually . How is India going to build such large capacity of 2.4
                million
                qualified, trained and competent nurses in a short time to serve its citizens growing health care needs
                across
                unevenly distributed Indian populace?<br />India’s rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy
                and
                changing lifestyles, changing patterns of disease, creating a strong demand burden on the health care
                industry.
                It is starkly evident that India lags in health care spend, infrastructure, qualified and competent
                workforce.<br />Need for integrating Information & Communication Technology Assisted Learning (ICTAL) to
                build
                large capacity of educated, trained and competent nursing workforce. This Learning Systems consists of
                blended
                learning techniques to virtual reality simulations for improving nurse’s clinical skills, subject
                knowledge,
                critical thinking abilities, decision-making, and teamwork.<br />Student and Professional Nurses can
                access
                healthcare based interactive content and immersive real-time simulations to practice using digital
                devices for
                improving their clinical competence, reduce human errors thus enabling to deliver enhanced patient
                care.<br />This study proposes to design technological interventions for mitigating risk due to lack of
                competent nursing workforce in India’s impending future.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Visual Literacy is an essential skill to comprehend and interpret visual meaning
                efficiently.
                Previous research has claimed visual Literacy to be necessary for thinking, communication, and learning.
                Several
                researchers have realized the importance of visual awareness in children, which does not only benefit
                their
                visual skills but also their verbal skills, motivation, engagement, independence, and confidence.
                Despite having
                multiple advantages of introducing visual Literacy in the school curriculum, scant attention has been
                paid to
                introduce visual Literacy for school children in India. This study is an intervention to introduce
                visual
                Literacy through VL activity-book and scaffolding for primary school children. Several visual literacy
                tasks
                were developed and tested with primary school children in Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh, India). Preliminary
                study
                findings and recommendations are discussed. We argue for the design and implementation of such visual
                literacy
                activities as a part of the curriculum for Indian children to develop an eye for it and understand
                visuals in a

                work functions of the part and mechanisms used. The information and process trend vary as the technology
                develops through the life cycle, the traditional methods of farming and ever decreasing farm labor
                availability
                is making agriculture economically unviable and inefficient. There is a need to improve the way of
                working and
                design in the aspect of ergonomics and aesthetics, the research paper majorly focuses on the ergonomic

                provides
                better performance and reduces pain. Automation of farming practices has proven to increase the food

                are
                necessary during designing of letters. Letter identification is a fundamental phenomenon for reading a
                single
                letter or word or continuous text in any condition (Chahine, 2012). Without appropriate letter
                identification,

                performed with Bengali script and the letters were exposed to low contrast. It is presumed that the
                readers will
                identify the letters by their key structural aspect and such information will be captured by the
                eye-tracking
                device.<br />The elementary unit of letter construction are the basic anatomical features of
                letterforms. The
                designation ‘anatomical feature’ indicates a specific letter-part that is unique in letter formation.
                The letter
                identification is a process of decoding and encoding of such structural information. They are the
                fundamental
                components of letter identification. This paper explains the process of Bengali letter identification
                and
                reveals the letter-part information by recognizing the anatomical feature. In order to reveal the letter
                features, we exposed the letters under visual stress to establish the significance of anatomical
                features. Pelli
                et al. already proved that the letters expose their features under condition of visual stress (Pelli,
                Levi, &
                Chung, 2004; Pelli, Palomares, & Majaj, 2004; Pelli, Burns, Farell, & Moore-Page, 2006; Pelli, et al.,
                2006). In
                relation to the previous statement, an eye-tracking study was conducted under visual stress to
                understand the
                letter identification process of Bengali. The objective of the experiment is to direct the participants
                to
                identify the letters features during reading process. Here, we use the low contrast technique to hide
                letter
                stroke information that reduces the chance of getting recognised easily at once in the peripheral
                vision, but
                only recognizable in foveal vision. Participants have to read the letters with precise attention to
                identify
                letters under visual stress condition (Pelli, Burns, Farell, & Moore-Page, 2006; Pelli, et al., 2006;
                Pelli &
                Tillman, 2007).<br />The study has been done to extract the information about the vital letter-parts
                that
                involves in letter identification process. The result indicates that there is an active involvement of
                specific
                letter-parts in letter identification process and a list of specific or distinctive letter features has
                been
                prepared to guide type designers. A letter is distinguished by the specific letter-part or parts from
                other
                letters during the course of letter identification process. The combination of common and unique
                (specific by
                definition) letter-parts make the letter unique in the identification process. It is essential to know
                such
                letter information that can be useful during designing of letterforms.</p>

                Institute of
                Technology, Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>There are not many differences in buses used for long journeys for pilgrim-age
                purposes, with a
                common deluxe bus as regards to interiors. Passengers of different attitudes and comfort perceptions do
                differ.
                On inquiry to pilgrims and tour organizers in a preliminary investigation, it was noticed that
                sufficient
                attention is required to be given while designing the interiors of such public carriers but not much
                attention
                is paid so far, and no specific study was also carried out and normal buses with need-based
                modifications are
                being used. This may be due to the lack of in-depth knowledge about vehicle design, vehicle ergonomics
                etc., and
                the lack of sufficient financial strength of these body building companies to employ knowledgeable
                per-sons.
                This study aims at understanding the critical factors affecting passenger physical comfort as concerned
                with
                interior aspects of buses for long journeys. The scope of the study is limited only to the buses
                operating under
                pilgrimage activities. The survey was done to find out those factors and the samples were taken from
                Vrindavan,
                Dwaraka and Somanatham. The pilgrims were selected based on purposive and random sampling as the target
                respondents were mostly senior citizens for whom the concept of comfort and fatigue are pronounced.
                Questionnaires and meeting observations were used to have their views on physical comfort, accessories
                and other
                facilities, seating considerations, the place for movements etc. The study finds certain issues that
                appear to
                be vital for designing long-distance pilgrimage purpose buses..</p>

              <p><b>Can you see my pain? Evocative objects for comprehending chronic pain</b></p>
              <p>Jonathan Mathew (Independent Scholar) and Vivek Kant (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Chronic pain presents a rather unique design challenge. Unlike the traditional view of
                pain in
                which it is often to be averted, chronic pain cannot be simply done away with. Therefore, chronic pain
                requires
                an understanding of how people live with it everyday. Thus, the emphasis of our approach is to address
                pain in
                terms of comprehending it. one approach to chronic pain management is through seeking solidarity,
                achieving it,
                however, is not a straightforward matter. In this paper, we adopt a research by design approach to the
                design of
                evocative objects for chronic pain management through developing solidarity. Our article comprehends
                pain
                through a variety of critical perspectives, most notably from the theorist Elaine Scarry. It details the
                design
                process using a fish-trap model to arrive at the design of an evocative object to support solidarity
                between the
                one who suffers (self) and the one who seeks to understand the suffering (the other). In other words,
                the aim is
                to move beyond the notion of pain as measured to that of pain as revealed and expressed.</p>

              <p><b>Historiographical Study: Mapping the Topoi of Sustainable Design in Indian Context</b></p>
              <p>Asit Bhatt (National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) Gandhinagar)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In Order of Things, Michel Foucault subjected the discourse of historiography to a
                kind of
                Kantian analysis in order to uncover the epistemological conditions of the possibilities – ‘historical a
                priori’. For Foucault, there existed, for each historical era, a distinctive epistemological structure –
                an
                ‘episteme’; which then governed the manner in which thinkers would think and the discourse would be
                formed,
                without even directly intruding on the consciousness of the thinkers.<br />Here, the question is this:
                what is
                the ‘episteme’, if there is one, which forms and even informs ‘Sustainable Design’ research, education
                and
                thinking? and what role Indian worldview in general and its values in particular play within the
                discourse of
                ‘Sustainable Design’?<br />The paper argues that our current models of ‘Design Thinking’ are informed by
                European Renaissance's ‘humanist’ and ‘rationalist’ notions – mind’s autonomy over the material body /
                matter
                whilst carrying forward Victorian ‘utilitarian’ impulse. Our 'Design Thinking' is indeed anthropocentric
                – only
                to enhance human life on earth and thus, limiting in the context of what is broadly defined within the
                rubric of
                “Posthumanism”. Here, we need a paradigm shift to view us not as distinct, but as the intrinsic part of
                all
                living (life) as well as non-living (matter).<br />The paper echoes Ramanujanian, somewhat archetypal,
                question
                \"Is there an India way of (Design) thinking?\" whilst remaining critical to dualism – Man versus
                Environment,
                Culture versus Nature, Mind versus Matter etc. in favor of the ‘advaita’ (non-dual) – the holistic
                worldview of
                the Indian thought.<br />Eminent Indian psychologist Sudhir Kakar has noted that in India, people have a
                different kind of relationship to their immediate environment than the people in the west. Kakar opined
                that for
                the Indian people, the outer objects do not have a separate independent existence but these objects are
                intimately related to the self. In this precise sense, for people in India, there lie almost no
                distinction
                between their environment and themselves.<br />यस्तु सर्वानि भूतान्यात्मन्येवानुपश्यति ।<br />सर्वभूतेषु
                चात्मान
                ततो न विजुगुप्सते ॥<br />The wise man, who realizes all beings as not distinct from his own self, and
                his own
                self as the self of all beings, does not, by virtue of that perception, hate anyone. (Isha
                Upanishad:verse
                6)<br />The paper, partly reflective and partly research, involves a historiographical study in relation
                to the
                ‘humanising’ motif that first occurred in European Renaissance and later in the mid 19th century England
                in
                order to develop an ethical as well as a moral framework in what had emerged, after the industrial
                revolution,
                as an increasingly secularised and disenchanted world. The roots of our prevailing anthropocentic models
                of
                ‘Design Thinking’ may be traced back to European Renaissance and Victorian England, however, the paper
                concludes
                that in the midst of current ecological crisis, an alternative ethico-moral framework is required to
                examine our
                present cultural production. Here, traditional Indian thought namely the idea of ‘advaita’ (non-dual)
                might
                serve as a priori ground or ‘episteme’ for the Sustainable Design research, education and thinking.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Periodontists- Dental professionals associated with tooth scaling(cleaning) tasks are
                often
                prone to Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders(WMSDs). Tooth scaling involves the repetitive and
                forceful grip
                of scaling tool handle. Trauma related to hectic scaling job leave periodontists susceptible to upper
                extremity
                disorders like Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs) like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome(CTS) etc. Limited studies
                have
                been conducted to evaluate effect of tool handle design on upper extremity muscles involved in
                periodontal task.
                Optimally designed dental scaling tool design is expected to reduce the prevalence of WMSDs in
                periodontists.
                Twelve variations of modified dental scaling tool handle sleeves were fabricated using 3-d printing
                technology.
                Design parameters like diameter and shape were assessed while performing simulated scaling task. The
                individual
                and interactive effects of design parameters on upper extremity flexor/extensor muscles were recorded by
                Electromyography (EMG). Thumb pinch force readings were recorded simultaneously. Results of the study
                indicated
                the reduction in muscle and thumb pinch forces in octagonal handle having 11mm diameter. Proving taper
                to the
                tool handle design was also responsible for reduction in muscle loads. The current study not only aims
                at
                guiding the periodontists for adopting optimally designed tool but also engineers and researchers to
                design
                ergonomically sound tool handle designs.</p>

                the push
                and figure-of-eight methods. Three mopping professionals each in three different height categories (5th,
                50th,
                and 95th percentile person according to Indian anthropometric data) participated in floor mopping
                experiments
                conducted in two different laboratory set-ups. In the first set-up, continuous positional data of
                participant’s
                joints (wrist, elbow, and shoulder) were recorded using a six-dimensional electromagnetic tracking
                system (ETS)
                and angular variation of the joints was evaluated for the two mopping techniques. In the second set-up,
                the
                three-dimensional positional data of body movements were recorded using optical motion capture cameras
                in
                mopping experiments to identify Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) score at extreme postures. The total
                RULA
                score obtained in push (4.6-5) for all height categories is less than the figure-of-eight (6.4-6.6)
                method,
                indicating less postural load during push mopping technique. This research confirms that mopping
                professionals
                are highly susceptible to postural loads/discomfort and the need of ergonomic design solutions are
                essential to
                reduce the observed risk.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Vibratory compactors are primarily used for compaction tasks in earthwork and road
                building.
                They are regularly exposed to vibrations caused by the moving elements within them like drum, engine
                etc., and
                the unevenness of the road or soil profile. Because of these vibrations, the structures are subjected to
                dynamic
                loads and the operators are endangered to health issues. A higher prevalence of spine problem, pain in
                chest,
                abdomen, arm and shoulder are found in the drivers of the compactors. Strict norms concerning these
                health
                issues make the design of an effective operator compartment inevitable on the compactors. At present
                Indian
                earth moving equipment manufacturers follow ISO 2631-1 and ISO 5349-1 to ensure the operator comfort in
                the
                compactors. These standards insist practical testing of the operator compartment which can be time
                consuming.
                The frequency of dynamic loading plays a pivotal role in determining the operator comfort as well as the
                damage
                of the operator compartment structures. The major vibrating frequencies prevailing in the compactor are
                its drum
                operating frequencies and engine rotating speeds. In order to protect the operator from health issues
                and the
                structures from failure, the operator compartment should be designed in a way that its natural
                frequencies evade
                the major vibrating frequencies prevailing in the compactor. In this work an effort has been made to
                develop a
                methodology using finite element analysis (FEA) to improve the operator comfort of the compactors. The
                FEA
                results have been compared with that of experimental testing and the FEA methodology has been fine-tuned
                to get
                a good correlation. In future this FEA approach will be used to finalize the operator compartment design
                prior
                to practical testing with an objective of reducing the development cost and time and ensuring the
                operator
                comfort.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the present era, with rapidly changing measures and uncertainty, it is beneficial
                for
                researchers, organizations, as well as for the government to anticipate future events. The substantial
                economic
                boost in the on-demand service sector leads to the development of home services in India. On-demand
                services
                have created new opportunities and challenges to all Stakeholders in delivering products and services.
                As
                increasingly products and services sold over the Internet, it becomes all the more essential to build up
                knowledge of design in planning and anticipating future events. This paper provides user behavior
                analysis and
                plausible futuristic scenarios with the practical case of domestic plumbing services. The research aims
                to
                identify the interrelationships and significance of service aspects in domestic plumbing. The study also
                aims to
                understand the future in this context through scenario development.<br />We conducted in-depth
                interviews,
                including exploratory surveys. The purpose of the survey was to study the ‘plumbing tools’ and service
                aspect’
                in domestic plumbing. During the survey, we critically observed the possible requirement and
                relationships of
                plumbing tools, service providers, and users. Structured questionnaires were developed to study various
                aspects
                of stakeholders of the system viz. plumbing service provider, plumber, and users. Further, insights from
                the
                survey result were incorporated into scenario planning. Scenario planning was used to discover new
                strategic
                options for the future and to gain a deeper level of foresight.<br />The study revealed aspects of
                customer
                service requirements and related components viz. corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance,
                operation time,
                service frequency, replacement of spare parts, consumables, fittings, and pricing. Chi-Square test
                results show
                a significant difference of frequency of preventive maintenance with residential typology (sig.=0.001);
                servicemen responsiveness with residential typology (sig = 0.019). Also, from the One-way ANOVA test, it
                has
                been observed that the frequency of dripping faucets issues significantly varies with occupation (sig =
                0.005)
                and residential typology (sig = 0.039). Running toilet issue significantly vary with locality (sig =
                0.036) and
                leaky pipes issue with residential typology (sig = 0.004). Scenario planning accounts for the effect of
                multiple
                drivers of change, trends, and delivers significant possibilities, risks, and opportunities. In this
                study, we
                identified the driving forces of change and trends for domestic plumbing from four perspectives viz.
                political,
                economic, social and technological. The political drivers of change are Skill India, Digital India,
                Pradhan
                Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, and National Skill Development Corporation. The economic drivers of change
                are gig
                economy, family income, demand, and supply. The social drivers of change are buying habits, lifestyle,
                education, and online platforms. The technological drivers of change are video in real-time, mixed
                reality, and
                drone delivery.<br />This study provides an integrative approach of user behavior study and scenario
                planning
                for service design with special emphasis to domestic plumbing. It acts as a road map for service design
                in
                general; primarily to similar service sectors viz. electrical maintenance, domestic appliances
                maintenance,
                carpentry, etc. The study will benefit students and practitioners in the field of service design. It
                would
                finally contribute to design for development.</p>

              <p>Shamit Shrivastav (Indian School of Design and Innovation, Mumbai) and Rahul Joshi (Mahindra & Mahindra
                Ltd.)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Product Planning is the foremost and an integral part of the NPD (New Product
                Development)
                process today. The primary role of the product planning function is to define and conceptualize the
                \"right\"
                product – right for the customers, right for the business, right for all the key stakeholders, and right
                for the
                environment. The Product Planning process involves understanding the customer needs through market
                research,
                translating those needs into product specifications, and creating a positive business case for the new
                product.
                However, with the rapidly changing market scenario, intense competition, the advent of new technologies,
                and
                regulatory trends, the conventional product planning process does not always lead to the expected
                business
                output. product planners must get the new product definition right in the first attempt itself.
                Engineers in the
                Research and Development (R and D) function use this product definition to evaluate the feasibility of
                the
                design and develop real products. It is, therefore, evident that the margin for error in the Product
                Planning
                process is zero. Design Thinking is a human-centered problem-solving approach that can solve a social,
                economic,
                environmental, or business problem and uncover high opportunity areas. Using a case study of a leading
                Indian
                automotive and construction equipment OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), this paper demonstrates how
                design
                thinking enabled an organization to conceptualize a new category-creating product that captured
                significant
                market share in just two years of launch and how the organization developed it in less than three years.
                This
                paper illustrates the potential of the Design Thinking process for new product development and discusses
                the
                possibilities of scaling it to different sectors. The paper also explains the critical roles of a
                designer in
                this process when working in a cross-functional team</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Art and design are increasingly important in Indian school curricula. But there is no
                specific
                pedagogy to teach this subject. Different school follow different methodology to teach art. For
                instance, some
                school follows traditional Indian and western painting, clay modelling and art history, on the other
                hand, few
                schools follow only craft making technique and copying traditional folk art such as Madhubani painting,
                Warli
                painting and Kalamezhuthu painting. As a result, there are few significant gapes are identified in
                student
                learning. The majority of students neither achieving basic understanding of creating art or develop
                design nor
                skill. Although, Art education in India in 2010 reported clearly that it is a significant tool for
                equipping
                students to simulate cognitive development and encourage innovative and creative thinking. And it also
                emphasis
                on using electronic media aids to teach this subject. Nevertheless, the majority of the school are
                giving less
                importance to teach art and they do not take the initiative to develop better pedagogy.<br />However,
                education
                pedagogy in recent decades has struggled to develop new methods and tools for better learning. Virtual
                Reality
                (VR) is one of the major solutions of technology-driven pedagogy. It provides a super real,
                simulation-based
                environment for teaching and training. It allows to visualize of abs content, provide information with
                clarity,
                and allow students to actively participate in the learning environment. Bodily engagement in free space
                will
                give them playful engagement with the topic and they will be able to explore it from a different point
                of view.
                The teacher can explain the topic in many possible ways and make the student understand easily. On the
                other
                hand, a playful interactive teaching design can enhance learning motivation, engage more deeply and
                inspire the
                student to learn. In this changing condition, the pedagogy of art and design requires new tools and
                methodology.<br />In this study, the researcher introduced a concept of a teaching-learning design using
                of
                virtual reality technology so that the grade 6 student learns art and design. To develop this immersive
                environment based on VR, the researcher followed a research methodology based on practice. The content
                is
                developed on elements of art and the topics have been chosen from National Council of Educational
                Research and
                Training (NCERT) art education program. During this learning phase, the student will learn to observe
                and draw
                simple objects. They began to understand of contour line, shape, form, the difference between 2D and 3D
                objects
                and perspective and student learn best by experiencing abs points in a 3D environment. The result of
                this study
                shows the procedure and criteria for content design with the aid of virtual reality for the study of art
                and
                design. In addition, this study examines aspects of how virtual reality helps in terms of designing the
                teaching
                strategy.</p>

                Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Sit To Stand (STS) transfer is one of the most common difficulties faced by the
                elderly. The
                present paper aims at identifying the STS transfer difficulty among Indian elderly and also focuses on
                the need
                for an appropriate STS transfer aid. The study was undertaken in 2018 on 200 elderly respondents having
                difficulty in STS movement. Self-structured questionnaire and other scales viz. Mini-Mental State
                Examination
                (MMSE) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) were applied to assess the needs and problems of Indian elderly in STS
                tasks.
                The results show that among all the respondents a large number of females in the age group of 60-70
                years had
                STS transfer difficulty. High Body Mass Index (63.5%), Osteoarthritis (69%) and Vegetarian diet (58%)
                was noted
                among respondents. The impaired ability of sit-stand transfer affected their capacity in carrying out
                important
                activities of daily living. The elderly also faced trouble in STS movement particularly in Western
                Toilet (WT)
                and Indian Toilets (IT). Walking stick users also found difficulty in STS tasks at many places. Thus, a
                need was
                identified to develop an assistive aid to help the elderly in STS transfer particularly in WT and IT,
                along with
                a modified walking stick, which could serve the dual purpose of mobility and STS transfer.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Agricultural waste burning is a significant source of pollution in India, especially
                after the
                harvesting season. Bio-brick was developed as an alternative and sustainable building material that is
                made up
                of agricultural waste. And at the same time will also lead to the reduction of air pollution and create
                new jobs
                at the grassroots level. This research paper defines the relationship between Bio-Bricks and circular
                economy
                model and its benefits to the rural economy and society as a whole. It has both direct and indirect
                benefits
                such as reduction of air pollution and the potential to be reused at the EOL or as filler material. It
                also
                documents the process of initial testing and product development. Product iteration started with
                creating blocks
                of bio-bricks, followed by initial experiments to determine physical properties. These results led to
                the
                redevelopment of product in term of forms and functionalities. New iterations can also be used for
                industrial
                settings such as enclosure for machinery and equipment as a sandwich or reinforced boards. Manufacturing
                of
                Bio-Bricks has the potential to eliminate the problem of disposal of agricultural waste at source. It
                can create
                a new economic model for farmers and lead to the development of agriculture-based industries. Based on
                our
                research findings, we find Bio-bricks can be developed as a carbon-negative, sustainable and
                economically viable
                material for construction. With the right kind of product development and incentives, it can diversify
                into
                numerous products satisfying the needs of an ecologically sensitive future.</p>

                Hyderabad)
              </p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Root Canal Treatment (RCT) is one of the standard dental procedure commonly done by
                dentist
                throughout the world. It involves removing infected pulp tissue from the tooth's pulp chamber and
                canals,
                cleaning and shaping of the root canals, disinfection of the hollow canal and filling it with
                \"gutta-percha\"
                or root canal sealer. Nonetheless, it is found that many of the RCT procedures fail due to inadequacies
                like
                missing of root canal orifices, improper cleaning or difficulties in locating the orifice. In most of
                the case,
                the failure of the treatment leads to persistent pain and secondary infection, which ultimately force
                the
                patient to undergo a subsequent RCT or extraction. Several clinical immersion sessions were conducted at
                MNR
                Dental College and Hospital and Malla Reddy Institute of Dental Sciences to understand the issues and
                problem-related to this root canal treatment. They were followed by an online questionnaire survey to
                gather a
                broader perspective of medical practitioners. After a year-long study, we were able to identify a few
                areas
                where design intervention can lead to the overall improvement of the root canal treatment and also can
                improve
                the workflow and comfort of the dentist. This research paper documents and highlights the research to
                find an
                unmet clinical need. This research project, though in its nascent stage, has shown great potential and
                with
                further research and development can lead to the development of a medical device that helps to improve
                the
                efficiency of the root canal treatment.</p>

                involvement of multiple stakeholders, socio-political and environmental changes across the globe make it
                more
                complicated. In order to explore the effectiveness of the service design approach, methods and tools for
                citizen
                services, we undertook a speculative case study of Indian Postal services.<br />The study was broadly
                divided
                into research, analysis, ideation and conceptualization stages. A mix of quantitative and qualitative
                methods
                was used for user research, and derived insights were taken forward through ideation workshops using
                tools
                provided by CraftChange-service design for behaviour change framework. Ideas were clustered to create a
                service
                ecosystem comprising of peripheral as well as core services for India Post. This study emphasizes on
                adopting
                differentiating practices, tools and methods while designing citizen services, to achieve greater
                adoption and
                sustained usage of the services. Service design for behaviour change approach towards citizen services
                seems to
                be promising to have more holistic, valuable and sustainable services for the users, service providers,
                associated organizations and the society and environment.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The paper presents an agricultural-based fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
                which is
                capable of spraying chemicals (pesticide/fertilizer). Aerial pollination, aerial sowing of seeds and
                similar
                tasks can be accomplished by effortless swapping of the payload. It makes these agricultural tasks
                simple,
                cost-effective and time-efficient. UAV reduces contact with pesticide during spraying and also
                eliminates the
                use of manned aircraft. Thus increases the safety of humans by preventing the ill effects of chemicals
                (pesticides) and fatal accidents of manned aircraft. Paper emphasizes the importance of UAV in the
                agricultural
                sector to ensure human safety and to increase the efficiency of farming. It incorporates aircraft
                design,

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>India is an emerging economy and has shown the great increase in the production of
                crops
                particularly after green revolution. New kinds of seeds, fertilizers, machinery and sowing techniques
                have
                helped a lot in meeting the needs of a country in terms of grains per hectare. Due to rapid development,
                there
                is an increase in overall pollution giving rise to greenhouse gases, ultimately depleting the ozone
                layer along
                with the rise in seawater level causing various problems ahead. Air pollution is particularly increasing
                various
                Respiratory diseases even in small children, which is the major concern for society. To reduce the ounce
                of this
                ever-increasing pollution the Stubble Removing Machine (SRM) is designed and developed for fully
                controlling the
                pollution due to burning of paddy stubble. Earlier the only method to clear the agriculture land was to
                burn the
                paddy stubble after the harvesting, due to which a lot of harmful gases like COx and NOx and their
                derivatives
                are at peak of their production.<br />Various other machines were developed including Stubble Management
                System
                (SMS) and its higher version called super SMS, but were not so promising according to their application
                procedure. The present developed machine works on the principle of cutting, collecting and managing the
                paddy
                stubble and clears the fields instantaneously for the next crop, also vanishing the problem of pollution
                due to

              <p>Sree Mahit Munakala (Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati), Chetan Manda (Indian Institute of
                Technology

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Designers are posed with problems which typically require an approach involving
                knowledge and
                expertise sourced from multiple disciplines. This leads to a breakdown of boundaries surrounding these
                disciplines, posing unique challenges in working towards a common goal. The design community often
                relies on
                specific predefined design processes to tackle complex, open-ended problems. They help designers convert
                ambiguous problem areas into concise pain points that facilitate targeted problem-solving. The design
                processes
                currently used are either problem-oriented or solution-oriented, whereas a hybrid structure is required
                to
                accurately reflect a designer’s approach to solving a problem. Further, considering the complex nature
                of
                interdisciplinary design and the ever growing need to consider multiple disciplines, allowing room for
                integrating the nuances that come with interdisciplinary design is important.<br />We took up a
                real-life
                interdisciplinary project where we worked on tackling problems for the hearing-impaired community. The
                problem-solving approach involved expertise from multiple disciplines at every stage of the project,
                including
                computer science, medical research, speech pathology, psychology and design. We observed an overarching
                framework when interacting with experts from different disciplines. This framework was further modified
                and
                refined across the different stages of the project. Documenting the insights from this project, we
                propose the
                Infinity Process, a framework that can be applied while working in interdisciplinary product
                teams.<br />The
                Infinity Process is a framework that takes into account the facets of research, design, development and
                testing
                while also addressing the gap of need validation and iteration, which typically occurs during a product
                development cycle. This paper starts by describing the primary approach to problem-solving involving an
                outcome.
                We then break down and redefine the design process into four distinct phases. The first phase redefines
                the
                framework to cater to a value generation-oriented outcome. The second phase focuses on defining the need
                behind
                the problem and validating the pain points associated with the need. The third phase focuses on the
                building the
                final solution, where design, development and testing teams are sequentially incorporated. The final
                phase
                explains how the entire framework works cyclically, wherein the need is redefined depending on the
                feedback
                received from the other disciplines involved. Each phase focuses on one aspect of product development.
                Designers
                are encouraged to apply the four frameworks starting from any phase, thereby eliminating rigidity of the
                process. Designers may also use each phase of the framework independently, depending on their respective
                stage
                of product development.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Indian handlooms are rich in their traditional styles and popular across the world.
                Each
                handloom technique has its unique ethnic features. However, the ethnic features are constantly
                undergoing change
                due to acculturation, innovation and various other factors, which can signifi-cantly affect the
                authenticity of
                the products, and thereby consumers’ purchase intention. The present research was carried out to
                identify the
                ethnic features and judging the authenticity of handloom products from handloom clusters of Assam
                through visual
                analysis. A Mixed-methodology was adopted by incorporating a critical review of litera-ture, in-depth
                ethnographic study, and photographic documentation. Images of handloom products were collected from
                ethnic
                clusters of Assam, namely Sualkuchi, Bijoynagar, Chaygaon, and Boko. Semiotic analysis of the collected
                27
                images (stimuli) was performed by expert designers (n= 20) to achieve the goal of the current research.
                The
                out-come of this study was a detailed matrix of smallest elements and their arrangement that form the
                syntactic
                analysis. Details in terms of influ-ence or source of inspiration were studied in syntagmatic analysis.
                It was
                found that the motifs were traditionally inspired by naturally available flora and fauna, culturally
                significant
                elements, and mytho-logical characters. Presented analysis technique can be referred by de-sign
                practitioners,
                artisans, and researchers to identify ethnic features of handloom products based on traditional
                signatures
                during their de-sign ideation. Identified visual design features would facilitate the re-tention of
                traditional
                inspiration during the process of product devel-opment and diversification.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This contribution presents a real world case study and experimentation based on the
                Serendipity,
                Ambiguity, Laterality, and Tangibility (SALT) conceptual architecture. We present early-stage design
                engineering
                processes (DEP) coupled with assisted human-machine creativity and directed towards research
                out-of-the-lab in
                which we engaged public participation during a nine-day public design event in The Netherlands. The
                study and
                experiment(s) were executed and conducted (i.e. early-stage research) with hybrid design tools (HDTs)
                and
                -environments (HDTEs) support systems. All the interaction data was acquired and mined with various
                observation
                and capture technologies and stored real-time on a data repository. A feedback loop (real-time) was made
                available to participants synthesized from user generated content and data. The design task to be
                executed
                voluntarily by heterogeneous users, was to create user generated content by expression through narrative
                of
                experiences (e.g. associative reasoning), audiovisual representations (e.g. designing, engineering)
                based on a
                prescribed context, externalization of opinion and address meaning. People were free to interpret, take
                position
                and/or add perspective individually and/or collaboratively, while immersing themselves in storytelling,
                audification, and visualization strategies. Building stories iteratively through narrative and
                representations
                is like building bridges between different worlds to create understanding, foster awareness, changing
                scope and
                enhance insights into the world-around-you. The challenge now is to rethink completely the processes
                according
                to the available technologies proposing new design models, iterative-layered processes and/or
                architectures that
                can leverage the digital continuity in both physical- (PPD), virtual- (VPD) and hybrid product*
                development
                (HPD). Whatever meaning or intention one may have, in essence and in general, people ‘shape and design’
                their
                own lives and ‘form’ their own perspectives on life. Individualized design combined with collaborative
                dynamic
                activity (e.g. discussion, narration, negotiation) in conjunction with hybrid design tools, have the
                capacity to
                act as the missing link between humans, society, and technology (STS) thereby addressing the fundamental
                core
                issues (e.g. regional, national, international) and global challenges at hand. The PLAYGORA design
                environment
                entails innovative interactive software solutions and design tools to create meaningful communication,
                experiences, personal involvement and social inclusion within various contexts and/or domains. People
                cannot
                feel data, however, by tangibly taking advantage of touch (a simple emotional phenomenon), add ambiguity
                in
                visual stimuli, we aim to stimulate the lateral thinking capacity and capability in people (i.e. users)
                possibly
                leading to serendipitious events and novel and/or alternatives in ‘design’ outcome.<br />*Product could

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Research on emotion and design literature has relied primarily on the
                product<br />generated by
                the designers and the emotional experience felt by the users while using the product. A limited number
                of
                studies have addressed the dynamics of the designer's emotions during the design process. This
                exploratory study
                attempts to understand the emotional experience of designers during the design process with supporting
                empirical
                evidence. Twenty-five designers were asked to carry out a design task for a limited period of time. The
                data was
                analyzed using the FBS ontology framework, linkography, and PANAS ratings to establish the dynamics of
                the
                emotions during the design process based on the video and audio recordings of the task. This study
                demonstrates
                mostly positive affect throughout the design process with associated high entropy scores and high
                outcomes,
                where the affective states varied between different time intervals and at different phases of the design

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The graphic design education in many postcolonial geographies, including India, is
                heavily
                inclined towards the Bauhausian and Swiss schools of thought with a philosophical rootedness in the
                western
                worldview. The contemporary discourse of design pedagogy, there have been only a handful of attempts,
                like Asian
                Design paradigm, to explore alternative frameworks and understand the visual design-culture through the
                decolonial lens. The research aims to experiment and evolve the fundamentals of visual design borrowed
                from the
                literary principles from indigenous knowledge systems. In the scope of the study, Alankars, a crucial
                literary
                aspect of Hindi Vyakaran (Hindi grammar system) are explored and employed to create a new decolonised
                visual
                design framework.<br />Alankar, or grammatical ornaments, enriches a literary composition through either
                playful
                structure or enhanced meaning. The study explores the two meta-alankar types, Shabd (word) and Arth
                (meaning),
                which conceptually relates to syntax and semantics, and experiment through a variety of new
                compositions. The
                pragmatics of the new compositions employ a folk-art tradition form from northern India, Madhubani. The
                compositions using the visual elements and styles of Madhubani attempts to replicate the structures in
                Shabd
                Alankar and meanings in Artha Alankar. Further, the sub-types of Alankar, including Anupras, Yamak,

                Rupak, Utpreksha, Atishyokti and Manvikaran along with their idiomatic examples, are transliterated into
                visual
                compositions. To work further, a motif library assists the exploration in providing a variety of
                options.<br />This study attempted to construct a visual grammar / visual compositions framework through
                consciously working on syntax, semantics and pragmatics of visual design. The first two components,
                syntax and
                semantics, were explored as Alankars while latter, pragmatics, was employed to assist comprehension of
                composition through contextual understanding, here Madhubani. The pragmatics further allows exploring
                the
                subjectivity through the details in the artwork, reminiscent of the artistic freedom in the Madhubani
                and other
                Indian art traditions. The research highlights the potential of indigenous knowledge to offer a
                methodological
                lens for visual design. This indigenous knowledge exploration can be instrumental in bridging the gap
                that
                exists in learning design and its principles in our cultural context and environment.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The identity of culture also comes from its language. India, which is known for its
                diversity in
                culture, each language that exists establishes a cultural identity. In this paper, an exploration
                conducted on
                reviving the identity of the Assamese script which represents Assamese language and culture of
                North-East India
                has been described. The exploration outlines initially the need, the resources, the applicability, and
                the
                design considerations. Then further it proposes a design alternative of the Assamese script in the form
                of a
                Typeface which may address the need to bring back the original essence of the script that was present in
                its
                historical form. The very idea of this exercise is to establish an identity for Assamese culture and
                language in
                the digital platform with the help of its script, which could be represented by a new Typeface that
                addresses
                the originality and tradition with historical essence.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Aesthetic appeal and cultural meaning of product are two key aspects which are
                becoming very
                popular in consumers and which are highly influencing consumer’s buying decisions in today’s competitive
                market.
                Color, Material and Finish (CMF) Design works around aesthetic values and cultural connections which are
                based
                on emotional values. Cultural CMF elements are considered to be a unique character to embed into a
                product for
                the enhancement of product identity in the global market and for the fulfillment of the individual
                consumer’s
                experiences. The intent of this paper is to study the impact of Indian culture-oriented CMF design on
                contemporary product’s aesthetic and semantic attributes. The research work has been carried out in two
                stages.
                Firstly, visual audit conducted to understand the impact of Indian culture-oriented CMF design on visual
                identity of product by re-visiting past and current trends. Secondly, effort has been made to find out
                differences in the visual product perception of the designers and users by using Semantic Differential
                (SD)
                tests. One-way ANOVA test carried out to analyze the results achieved from SD test. The result shows
                that Indian
                culture-oriented CMF design creates a significant impact on contemporary product aesthetic and semantic
                values.
                If contemporary product aesthetics is designed considering Indian users’ perception and their needs then
                products will have enhanced semantic values and products will become more meaningful for users. Indian
                traditional CMF elements will help to create product identity in the global market.</p>

                not changed
                lately. Majority of the settings organizing eye screening camps, lack the necessary facilities and do
                not meet
                the general medical standards. Adverse terrain conditions also do not allow for medical mobile unit vans
                to be
                an option in such areas. Such factors result in the exclusion of a significant portion of the
                population, who
                are at risk of developing ocular abnormalities due to diabetes and other farm-related
                injuries.<br />Field
                studies conducted in eye camps of rural Assam and subsequent interviews with healthcare providers and
                recipients
                established the novelty of the information. Considering these constraints as an opportunity, the author
                engaged
                the healthcare experts for mining a context-specific design from the perspective of the specialists. The

                studies
                were shared with a team of healthcare experts. The healthcare team by means of a design workshop, tried
                to
                address user needs in their concept design.<br />This research examines the role of association of

                reflect the
                ver-satility of design education in addressing socially significant problems, intending to direct it
                towards the
                unmet healthcare needs in low-resource settings. Such context-specific interventions can open the

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the industry 4.0 era, the assembly-line work forms the basis of various
                manu-facturing
                industries viz. the automotive, the electronic component manufacturing, and the Fast Moving Consumer
                Goods
                (FMCG). FMCG assembly lines are dis-tinct from the automotive and the electronic component manufacturing
                assembly lines. These are high paced, and semi-automatic in nature and comprises short-cycled repetitive
                work.
                The researchers and engineers have taken several different approaches to improve the assembly-line
                related work
                in automotive and electron-ic component manufacturing industries, from a design and ergonomics
                perspec-tive.
                However, very little is known about such design and ergonomic interven-tions pertaining to FMCG
                assembly-lines.
                This paper aims to find out to what ex-tent the same/ similar approaches associated with ergonomic
                design
                interventions applied in assembly-line work in diverse industrial sectors can be adopted/ ap-plied to
                the FMCG
                sector to improve productivity and OSH following the state-of-art literature review. Hence, the current
                paper
                assesses the need and determines the scope of ‘Ergonomic Design Interventions’ in assembly-line-related
                work in
                the FMCG sector. In this paper, authors have emphasized and advocated imple-menting ergonomic principles
                in
                assembly-line work of the FMCG sector in con-junction with productivity enhancement tools/ techniques to
                ensure

              <p>Nikhil Zope (Tata Consultancy Services)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>With design becoming more and more explicitly recognized and used as part of the
                innovation in
                businesses, design innovation as a discipline is also maturing. Design innovation is helping recognizing
                value
                creation explicitly in all stages of innovation. Innovation itself is moving from offering innovation to
                experience innovation and from a single business firm driven to ecosystems driven. In this paper, we
                review
                literature from design innovation discipline and business ecosystems discipline. From the literature
                review we
                establish that design innovation needs to go beyond offering innovation and address value creation
                within
                multiple firms from the ecosystem perspective. We also discuss business models of ecosystem participants
                and
                their influence on each other as first step in this research direction.</p>

              <p>Chaitanya Solanki (Indian institute of technology Hyderabad)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Thomas Nagel in his paper, „What is it like to be a bat?‟ highlights the problem of
                subjective
                experience. He talks about the problem of subjectivity, of how an observer, if not a bat, can never
                fully
                understand what it is like to be a bat. This paper takes on the above problem and attempts to utilize it
                to
                theoretically deduce that the problem of user subjectivity can be logically dismantled and the
                information
                gained can help in the domain of design processes. The P.O.L.E framework tries to utilize the social and
                biological aspect of the user‟s subjectivity and attempts to break it down by engaging in the pre-design
                stage
                of task-clarification. It aims at providing a more holistic perception of the user, by piecing together
                the
                various influences that might affect an individual‟s subjectivity. The proposed framework is in its
                adolescence
                but shows the potential to establish a base of information before the design process takes place. The
                research
                concludes with tentative future plans of how this framework will be further deployed and tested.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Nibedit Dey (ibrum technologies) and Priyabrata Rautray (Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In public health settings, most of the patients with respiratory-related complaints
                come with
                chronic conditions, where the disease has already progressed to an advanced stage that requires
                immediate care.
                As per the Global Asthma Report (2018), more than one billion patients suffer from Chronic Respiratory
                Diseases
                (CRD). Pneumonia is considered the single largest cause of mortality in children worldwide with over 2
                million
                deaths worldwide. Factors such as malnourishment, low zinc intake, overcrowding, exposure to parental
                smoking,
                indoor air pollution play an important role in increasing children’s susceptibility to respiratory
                infections.
                Due to the lack of pulmonologists in primary care centers and lack of time, patients remain undiagnosed
                which
                leads to a rise in the number of chronic disease cases. The problem is worse for babies suffering from
                pneumonia
                where any delayed diagnosis can be fatal. In a crowded and noisy atmosphere, it is extremely difficult
                to hear
                the sound of congested lungs through a normal stethoscope. Research says that even with a specialist
                doctor,
                physical diagnosis sensitivity is between 47-69% and specificity is between 58-75%.To improve our
                understanding
                of the screening process and gather clinicians’ perspectives on the need for a respiratory health
                assessment
                device, a number of face to face interviews were conducted, followed by an online questionnaire survey.
                We also
                documented the existing diagnosis methods and tests prescribed by clinicians to detect pneumonia.
                Children can
                be protected from pneumonia with a simple respiratory health assessment device and can be treated with
                low-cost
                medication and care. This research paper documents and highlights the need for a respiratory health
                assessment
                device. The research paper is divided into three segments; firstly it highlights the existing diagnosis
                methods
                for respiratory disease and issues related to it, secondly, recording and analysis of clinicians’
                perspectives
                and challenges. Finally, conceptualizing a novel solution to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of
                respiratory
                diseases.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Time spent at college is a happy experience and a fond memory for most of the students
                but for
                some it has many rough patches. Everyone's situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost
                all
                college students deal with at least once during the time they spend in college. 72% of students in India
                are
                unaware of how to deal with stress and its ill-effects as studied by Dr. S.G. George. A study by NIMHANS
                has
                also found that 11% of college students have attempted suicide because of stress.<br />The purpose of
                this study
                is to analyze the kind of stress design students go through and how taking help from a self-help
                books/texts can
                guide students to deal with the feelings, thoughts or behavior that come with stress and anxiety and can
                act as
                bibliotherapy for them. Self-help books take insights from psychological science and draw in particular
                on the
                newly developing ‘positive psychology’. There is evidence that bibliotherapy is effective in the
                treatment of
                psychological disorders.<br />To know how self-help books can help the design students, eight in-depth
                interviews with the current and former design students were taken who have experienced the stress and
                triumphed
                over that with the help of self-help books. A survey amongst the students was conducted to know about
                the stress
                they go through and how they deal with it, what they most need at that moment and their awareness about
                self-help books.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Introduction: The context of design innovation refers to harnessing human creativity
                for
                creation of value. With innovation pointing to transforming the ideas for success in the market place,
                it is
                considered a reasonable expectation for creativity based design practice to enable this particular
                transformation. The review of design innovation literature suggests that the practice ought to be
                explicit with
                regard to creation of value. As of now, the notion of value and creation of value is implicitly present
                in the
                current state-of-art of design practice. Hence there exists a necessity to improve upon the current
                design
                practice, in order for it to exclusively address ‘creation of value’. The proposed paper looks at this
                scope and
                presents the undertaken work as development of practice support.<br />Core Idea: The literature on
                business
                models refers to the rationale behind creation of value, which can be adapted into design practice.
                There are
                several perspectives on business models by various authors of which Business Model Canvas is most
                popular.
                Further the elements of this Canvas are grouped into a set of building blocks for ‘creation of value’ by
                other
                authors. Thereby these elements lend a handle to systematically address ‘creation of value’ through
                design
                practice. The development of Practice Support makes use of these building blocks and introduce the
                resulting
                approach as part of standard design phases, in order to address ‘creation of value’
                explicitly.<br />Proposed
                Contribution: Accordingly the proposed paper describes the various perspectives on ‘creation of value’
                from
                business models literature. The review of literature on design innovation is included in the paper. The
                overall
                understanding from review is leveraged to develop the practice support for design, through an empirical
                study.
                The stages in Design Research Methodology are adhered with, while developing this support. The Research
                Clarification stage refers to literature review in the area of design innovation to highlight the gap in
                the
                state-of-art of design practice to address ‘creation of value’. The Descriptive Study-I captures the
                literature
                review on business models in an attempt to describe the various perspectives on ‘creation of value’. The
                resulting understanding lends a handle towards developing the practice support. The subsequent
                Prescriptive
                Study involves a detailed empirical study towards developing the practice support for enabling ‘creation
                of
                value’ through design. Lastly, the Descriptive Study-II validates the developed practice support with
                reference
                to the context of startups, as these firms have an agenda for ‘creation of value’ aimed at certain
                intended
                stakeholders. This validation exercise involves applying standard design phases for a given startup firm
                context, towards its preparedness for translating its own value proposition to value realization.
                Thereby this
                exercise give rise to startup case studies in an attempt to demonstrate and illustrate the usage of the
                developed practice support.<br />Towards future work, the proposed paper refers to usage of business
                model
                patterns for detailed designing of business ecosystems. The developed practice support can be further
                strengthened with insights from the above extended context.</p>

              <p><b>Influence of Culture and Tradition in the Tribal Architecture of Meghalaya</b></p>
              <p>Srinidhi Ravishankar (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad) and Shiva Ji (Indian Institute of
                Technology
                Hyderabad)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Northeast India is dotted with several tribes and tribal communities. In a tribal
                context, art,
                architecture, and culture are intertwined into the day-to-day activities. Although most vernacular
                structures in
                the Northeast use similar locally available materials like bamboo, wood, mud, thatch, etc., they are
                different
                from each other. This factor of identity stems from their diverse cultural practices and beliefs. To
                explore the
                relationship between culture, art and architecture in Northeast India, taking the case example of
                Meghalaya. The
                paper further investigates the scenario by analyzing the two most important housing typologies of
                Meghalaya -
                Garo and Khasi houses. The paper investigates the relationship between culture, art and architecture by
                exploring different sub-factors of local and external influences such as traditional values, symbolism,
                mythology and belief system of the communities and their contributions to the development of the tribal
                architecture of Meghalaya. The intensity of the influence is carefully analyzed in the various building
                components of a habitat structure. The research synthesis is conducted to draw conclusions of how the
                traditional architecture of Meghalaya is influenced and enhanced by a mix of local and externally
                influenced
                belief systems, culture and art. This has led to various derivatives of elemental representations,
                motifs,
                patterns and semiotics in architecture. The traditional beliefs of tribes have shaped their settlement
                patterns
                and their housing structures. The aesthetics of the houses can be seen as a result of their
                mythology-based
                symbolism. Interestingly, the beliefs and taboos of the groups in construction have proven to have
                positive
                seismic, environmental and sustainable outcomes. All these characteristics, driven from culture and
                traditions,
                can be considered as the key reasons for their earthquake and weather-resistant characteristics.
                Culture, art,
                symbolism and the belief system has largely influenced the tribal architecture in terms of planning,
                aesthetics
                and semiotics, making them unique, localized and indigenous. However, their influence is gradually
                diminishing
                because of standardization and contemporary practices. It is commendable that though there is an
                increased usage
                of metal and modern construction materials in the form of metal roofs, bolts, and brick walls, the
                underlying
                values and interior planning remains the same.</p>

              <p>Mashahib Nawaz Hassan (IIT Guwahati) and Sharmistha Banerjee (IIT Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Research papers are a tremendous source of cutting edge knowledge. Writing a good
                research paper
                requires proper planning and structuring of paper which often comes from experience. Planning and
                structuring
                the research paper is a tedious task for novice researchers due to the lack of a process that could
                assist
                novice researchers to plan and structure their paper. To understand the mindset and problems faced by
                novice
                design researchers we conducted workshops on writing research paper based on a generic framework.
                Workshops
                provided us with helpful insights about how and what novice researchers think while writing research
                papers. We
                came up with a concept of using mindmaps that allows novice researchers to plan and structure the
                content of the
                research paper before writing the paper. It was observed that it reduced stress and anxiety about the
                contents
                of paper while writing it and researchers could focus more on the language of the paper while writing it
                that
                will directly increase the quality of paper in terms of its language and narration.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Inadequate planning and poor stake holder management are considered root cause to
                delays and
                cost overruns in Construction Projects. Compartmentalized working of various stakeholders prevents
                smooth flow
                of information to achieve intended Design-Construction Interface. The construction industry is gradually
                evolving to a manufacturing and product delivery process where design for Manufacturability and Assembly
                takes
                precedence. Pre Engineered and Pre Cast Construction technology is being adopted in many large span and
                high
                rise building projects due to its cost effectiveness in large volume. Optimization of targeted values
                viz
                manufacturability, assembly, maintenance, lifecycle cost and ergonomics becomes critical to ensure a
                smooth
                execution of the Project. Design for a specific target value according to the utility has been an
                evolutionary
                process. The objective of the study is to look into the relevance and effectiveness of an iterative
                approach in
                Design Process to streamline the Target Values to optimize effort and resources in employing Pre
                Engineered and
                Pre-Cast Technology. The study also examines the various factors influencing the smooth interface from
                design to
                construction and critically examine the bottlenecks. Design for X (DfX) approach gives the stakeholders
                more
                rationale inputs for monitoring and decision making in a more controlled environment of pre-engineered
                and
                pre-cast construction. A well-conceived work breakdown structure is mandatory for an assembly based
                construction
                methodology as skilled labour with right machinery plays a key role in sticking to the planned schedule.
                The
                Design-Build type of contract suits an innovative technology where guidelines are still in a formative
                stage.
                The study attempts to predict the future of manufacturability in construction where smooth assembly with
                minimum
                labour is getting preference over conventional cast-in-situ methodology. The bottom up approach of new
                policy
                initiatives and better communication between stakeholders promise more refined designs in future where
                technology will be pushed to align with Lean Construction principles which will form part of
                deliverables.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In highly competitive markets, companies have to develop innovative products or
                services through
                design projects. In such a product development in companies, it is crucial to have teams consisting of
                people
                from diversified backgrounds so that the teams develop innovative products. However, an increasing
                degree of
                diversity in a team does not directly link to a higher quality, namely creativity, of project outcomes.
                Diversity in a team can hinder the design process due to a decrease in common understandings and shared
                experiences.<br />Many scholars have attempted to define creativity. A common understanding of
                creativity is
                that a creative design outcome has ‘novelty’ and ‘usefulness’. As novelty refers to newness to the human
                race,
                we define a novelty is a degree to which an idea is rare, unusual, or uncommon. ‘Usefulness’ refers to
                ‘social
                value’, defined as the degree to which an idea applies to the problem at hand, effective and
                implementable, as a
                way to address ‘usefulness’ of design outcome. Usefulness can be divided into usefulness to users and
                feasibility.<br />Our goal is to support ideation activities by groups of people having
                multi-disciplinary
                backgrounds, especially engineering and arts. We hypothesise that there is a tendency that people prefer
                one
                aspect of ideas depending on the discipline of participants, which hinder group design activities.
                Increasing
                awareness of self-preference may help teams to conduct design activities. This paper focuses on the
                development
                of a questionnaire and clarify differences in preference between arts and engineering.<br />The
                questionnaire
                has pairs of ideas, each of which has an idea having a higher degree of feasibility but a lower degree
                of
                novelty (feasible idea) and the other idea has vice-versa (novel idea). Participants are asked to choose
                one
                good idea from each pair.<br />To develop the questionnaire, the authors firstly created eighty-four
                ideas. Each
                idea has an illustration and a brief explanation in texts. The ideas were evaluated by forty students
                with seven
                points Licker scale in terms of novelty and feasibility. The participants consist of twenty students
                majoring
                engineering and twenty studying arts<br />Each idea was shown with a description of target users and a
                design
                challenge towards for which the idea was created. Prior to the evaluation, the participants read brief
                definitions and examples of novelty and feasibility.<br />The responses were statistically analysed to
                find
                pairs, each of which has one idea of having significantly high feasibility compared to the other idea
                and the
                other having significantly high novelty compared to feasible ideas.<br />The developed questionnaire
                consists of
                seven pairs of ideas. The questionnaire was responded by both twenty students studying in engineering
                and twenty
                students studying in arts. As each pair has a significantly feasible idea and a significantly novel
                idea, the
                participants are forced to choose either feasible or novel ideas. Therefore, the number of feasible
                ideas and
                novel ideas chosen as good ideas by each participant reflect preferences of an aspect of creativity of
                ideas.
                The number was statistically analysed to explore differences between people studying engineering and
                arts.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Since the beginning of the machine age, vibration has become a significant part of a
                human being
                at the workplace. In general, the operators of the vehicle/machine exposes to vibration due to
                supporting
                surface, operating tools directly or indirectly in their daily life activities. These prolonged
                vibrations
                affect the human nervous system, digestive system, muscles function, upper and lower limb disorder etc.
                Head is
                the most crucial part of the human body. Hence, the study of vibration transmissibility between the
                source (seat
                surface, seat–buttock interface for seated occupants and foot for standing person) to head under dynamic
                conditions is an essential consideration in biodynamic modelling. To study the biodynamic response of
                the human
                beings under a wide range of vibration environments mostly researchers have performed experimental work,
                and
                minimal edition of mathematical models are present. However, remarkably few mathematical models mimic
                the
                structure of the real human being. In this article, a novel 10-degrees of freedom (dofs) human model
                which
                simulates the actual human structure is proposed. The spring and damper coefficients represent stiffness
                and
                damping of the human body (bone and muscle), respectively and are optimized through FireFly algorithm
                (FA). The
                conclusion is drawn based on the goodness of fit of experimental data presented in the literature with
                the tuned
                parameters of the human body obtained from FA. The performance of the developed human model is better
                than those
                reported in the literature. The evolved human model helps to monitor the whole body vibration occurred
                seated
                occupants.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Aquatic food crops which have significant economic importance due to their nutritional
                value are
                presently being cultivated globally. Farmers in developing countries still follow the traditional
                cultivation
                practices for these crops. Aquatic cultivation is entirely different from terrestrial culti-vation in
                terms of
                the physical environment, field condition, and cultivation technique. Among different stages of
                agricultural
                operations for a particular crop, harvesting is considered to be the most time consuming and require
                utmost care
                to collect consumable part of the crop. The current study aims to understand future research avenues in
                aquatic
                food crop harvesting. The paper highlights medicinal/ nutritional value, challenges in harvesting, and
                existing
                scenarios of availa-ble tools and techniques used in the harvesting of aquatic as well as terrestrial
                crops. It
                will help to identify the future scope of research towards design intervention to reduce the drudgery of
                aquatic
                farmers and improvement of productivity of aquatic food crops. For this purpose, relevant literature was
                searched from the major three electronic databases, namely Web of Science, Sco-pus, and Google scholar.
                A
                prominent research gap was found regarding the design and devel-opment of aquatic food-crop harvester
                considering the key constraints of the aquatic environment. Hence, the attention of agricultural
                engineers/

                Technology) and
                Dr Varsha Gupta (National Institute of Fashion Technology)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In this research paper, we describe the case study of an empathic design approach for
                designing
                a service based on the theory of Piaget's stages of kid’s development. Nowadays, the development of kids
                is
                getting influenced by the increased use of technology in our everyday lives. The case study has been
                conducted
                to understand their behavioural patterns around digital technology and identify the cues that trigger
                the usage
                of the device. The aim was to design an experiential service on the parameters of Piaget’s stages of
                development
                for kids in the age group of 3-5 years, focusing on enhancement their motor skills, sensory skills and
                also the
                cognitive skills in order to enhance their learning experience. The initial sample data has been
                collected from
                six parents; three boys and three girls, to map their present pattern around the screen time. By using
                empathy
                mapping as a tool for parents and kids belonging to the urban and metro cities a pattern was observed in
                the
                screen time spent in front of digital devices and the content watched. The paper study both the
                psychological
                and physical impact of increased screen time among kids. The data collected has been analysed based on
                Fog’s
                behaviour model which suggest that we act when three forces—motivation, trigger, and ability/
                accessibility
                —converge. As a result of all information collected, prototypes were developed and tested to inspect the
                acceptability of the proposed concept among the kids and caregivers and its efficiency to reducing the
                screen
                time. The case study strengthened the importance of an empathic design approach that provides a common
                platform
                to the users’ requirements and the designer’s analytical skill to design a service. The design study
                helped the
                caregivers to understand and explore the non-familiar sides of their kids and helped them to get more
                involved
                in the physical and mental growth of their kids.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>People living in low-resource settings at the base of the world income pyramid (i.e.
                Base of the
                Pyramid — BOP) face several constraints. To satisfy their unmet needs, integrated frugal innovations are
                necessary. Several studies, dis-cussed using many names such as ‘design for Base of the Pyramid’,
                ‘design for
                development’, ‘product service systems’, ‘frugal innovations’, ‘humanitar-ian engineering’, ‘appropriate
                technology’, etc., have explored the design of such integrated frugal innovations for the BOP. Based on
                ten key
                design as-pects, gleaned from such studies, this paper aims at developing an Integrated Design
                Methodology for
                designing frugal innovations for the BOP (Frugal-IDeM). We have related the key design aspects with the
                various
                phases in the design and development process. The Frugal-IDeM also includes recommen-dations for how to
                implement the key design aspects.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Technology is increasingly important in engaging millennials. Over the past few
                decades
                education pedagogy has struggled to develop new methods and tools to create better and higher quality
                education.
                In present schools need effective teaching and learning to convey and clarify the content of various
                subjects to
                students a first stage in their learning from primary stage of the students. With the help of virtual
                reality
                (VR) technology, teaching-learning can solve the restriction of space, time and act of learning. The VR
                technology also facilitate self-learning, problem-solving and help student to explore new
                ideas.<br />The
                subject of this research are sixth graders. Using VR environment, it is expected to develop a
                teaching-learning
                process of art and design topic. In traditional teaching of art and design at classroom, theoretical
                knowledge
                is more than hands-on learning and depth of learning process is insufficient. For instance, teacher
                describes
                the process or draw on the black-board and students are coping from books or doing imaginary drawing.
                This
                teaching procedure doesn’t have proper methodology and there is a chance to creates misconception of
                students.
                On this basis, VR technology-based art and design lesson is applied in the core curricula of art
                education in
                this study. Two sets of tests are conducted with sixth graders, one is pre and post-test with VR based
                lesson
                and other one is per and post-test with non-VR based lesson.<br />The result of this study found that
                the
                teaching outcome with VR and conventional teaching outcome has many significant difference. Applying VR
                technology in art and design teaching creates effective teaching environment where art and technology
                are
                combined, improved students theoretical knowledge, practical skill and help to improve quality teaching
                by
                optimizing teaching process. This study indicates two major points; one is how VR technology can be used
                as an
                art and design teaching tool. Other one is what are the significant changes are coming out in the
                students work
                by using VR environment based teaching.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The current study is aiming at demonstrating how to reduce the numbers of variables
                using
                Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to be measured in an anthropometry survey that involves sample data
                of large
                number of variables. A case study of analysis of anthropometric data involving PCA method has been
                reported
                based on the anthropometric data (32 anthropometric variables) of Ethiopian army personnel collected
                from 250
                male participants. The linear regression models were also constructed using least square method to
                predict the
                regression equation of relevant body variables that had correlation coefﬁcients (R) > 0.70. Variables
                having the
                lesser factors loading coefficient (&60#60%), commonality and correlation coefficients (&60#70%) were
                counted as
                independent variables and included in a minimum data set for measurement. The PCA provided six principal
                component factors. Total 21 regression equations of dependent variables were constructed from the six
                influential predictors. Therefore, we observed that the total 12 variables (six dominant variables, five
                variables with less commonality and/ or correlation coefficient from their respective predictors, and
                one
                targeted variable ‘mass’) can create a minimum data set that almost accounts for the variability
                produced by 32
                original variables. Hence, during data collection, 12 independent anthropometric variables can
                extensively
                represent 32 variables. The current case study would help the researchers to save time and reduce their
                anthropometric survey to these 12 variables that can predict the remaining ones. It would also guide the
                researchers to adopt PCA to identify the representative anthropometric variables from large number of
                variables.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Purpose - The increasing awareness and demand for producing environmentally
                sustainable products
                has stimulated the industries across the globe to implement ecofriendly practices in the development of
                various
                products. It is important to consider the environmental impact while conceptualizing a product but at
                the same
                time the choices of end users should not be overlooked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop
                an
                approach which has the capability to identify the key ecodesign practices as well as to consider the
                interests
                of the consumers while developing a sustainable product in the early design stage i.e., conceptual
                design
                stage.<br />Methodology/approach – In this study, an ecodesign based Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
                approach
                is proposed for developing the sustainable products. The QFD approach used in this study consists of
                three
                different phases. The first phase, known as ‘House of quality’, shows the relationship between the voice
                of
                customers and technical requirements of the product to be developed. A rating scale is used to develop
                the
                relationship between the customer requirements and technical requirements of the product. Then, the
                weight of
                each technical requirement is calculated. In second phase, the relationship of the technical
                requirements with
                different part characteristics of the product is established and weights are obtained for each part
                characteristic. Third phase relates the parts characteristics with various ecodesign practices spread
                across the
                entire life cycle of the product. Then, the key ecodesign practices are identified on the basis of their
                weights
                for developing a sustainable product life cycle.<br />Findings – The proposed methodology is applied for
                designing an environmentally conscious blower heater. The finding of this study shows that ‘Ensuring a
                higher
                durability,’ ‘Reducing energy consumption during use’ and ‘Ensuring easier maintenance and repair’ are
                the most
                significant ecodesign practices that must be emphasized while designing a blower heater.<br />Research
                implications/ limitations – The methodology developed in this research can assist the designers to
                develop
                ecofriendly products through the identification of the most relevant ecodesign practices for individual
                products. The main limitation of the proposed study is that it requires a team of designers to provide
                rating
                for each ecodesign practice. The ratings provided by a single designer may lead towards biased
                results.<br />Originality/value – Previous studies are not able to adopt a life cycle approach for
                developing
                products in conceptual design stage. The originality or novelty of this study lies in the fact that it
                helps the
                designers to plan the entire life cycle of the product in conceptual design stage of a product
                development
                process.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This study served as an attempt to better understand social relationships by using
                Facial
                Expression Electromyography (fEMG) Analysis. The goal was to be able to visualize social relationships
                through
                objective data to broaden understanding of the mechanism of social relationships and social design. This
                study
                focuses more on observed daily experiences as a means of comprehending social relationships among the
                participants, and to determine if social relationships can be understood using fEMG Analysis.<br />The
                authors
                conducted an experiment that compares the results of fEMG analysis with social relationship transitions
                recorded
                during a card game called mini-bridge. This is a game played in teams, and it requires that players work
                in
                pairs. It can clearly be seen whether the pair is successful in this co-creative relationship by
                checking the
                data recorded on video, and by seeing what cards are in each player’s hand and how they play the game.
                During
                the game, the participants wore electrodes on their corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major,
                allowing us to
                collect data using fEMG (objective results). Using a shared behavior and intentions study from the
                videos, the
                intersubjective state of the examinees were graded (subjective results) and compare to the objective
                results
                interpreted through the Levenshtein method.<br />The research results suggest the possibility of
                identifying a
                social relationship as a partnership by using fEMG with data from the corrugator supercilii. This study
                will
                contribute to our knowledge of the mechanism of social relationships, which is needed to develop a
                methodology
                for social design.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Introduction: In this paper, we present the process, outcome and learning from a
                project for
                developing assistive products using desktop manufacturing methods (which includes additive
                manufacturing/3D
                printing, Laser cutting, CNC machining). The project focussed on people with disability leading to the
                restricted use of one hand, e.g. one-hand amputees, hemiplegics, and people with congenital anomalies.
                Six
                assistive devices were developed for the above user group which are as follows: Shoelace tying device,
                Lace
                tying device, Modified scale, Dupatta-pinning device, Button hook, and Toothbrush
                holder.<br />Methodology: The
                development of all the devices followed a typical user-centric design process which started with
                empathising
                with the users and conducting an interview with them, shortlisting areas for intervention, ideation and
                conceptualizing, iterative prototyping, testing with people who were asked to use only one limb while
                trying out
                the device, and finally receiving feedback from the intended users of the products.<br />Feedback and
                Results:
                Feedback on the devices was taken remotely. Three participants with disability in one upper limb were
                asked to
                rate each of the selected prototype on six different parameters such as the perceived ease of use,
                efficiency of
                problem solving, intuitive design, etc. on a Likert scale, and comment upon them.<br />Conclusion and
                Discussion: We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the inclusive design process we followed, the
                advantages
                of desktop manufacturing methods, and how they can be exploited in designing and production of
                customised
                assistive devices. Finally, we discuss the implications and future scope of the project.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The Ghanasyam House of Sivasagar district, Assam, India, is one of the detailed
                specimens in the
                ornamented brick architecture monument of the Ahom Dynasty. The monument is built during the reign of
                Ahom king
                Rudra Singha (CE 1696-1714), and it is protected under the Archaeological Survey of India, Guwahati
                circle,
                Assam(ASI). Multiple terracotta plaques are being used for the ornamentation that includes motifs,
                patterns,
                symbols, and sculptures. This paper aims to present a visual analysis of the motifs and patterns of the
                monument. The collected data of ornamentation are sorted considering a categorization theory. This paper
                investigates the visual composition analysis and symmetrical analysis of the ornamentation. The results
                provide
                detailed insight into the visual attributes of the motifs and patterns. The paper identifies the
                rudimentary
                principles compositions of the ornamentations within a specific frame of reference. The quantitative
                data
                analysis identifies the dominating motifs and pattern types and multiple symmetry operations.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Since its introduction in 2011, industry 4.0 has been coined the “4th industrial
                revolution”
                following mechanization, industrialization and IT/automation as the first three, and represents the
                current
                trend of automation technologies (cyber-physical systems, internet of things, cloud computing, etc.,) in
                the
                manufacturing industry, with their potential for disruption of the manufacturing paradigm as we know it.
                However, the effect and role of industry 4.0 on the design and development of the new products to be
                manufactured in industry 4.0 facilities is not clear. This research presents a literature review to; 1)
                understand the concept of industry 4.0 from an implementation (state of practice) viewpoint, 2) learn
                about
                approaches and considerations currently deployed for developing products to be produced in manufacturing
                plants
                progressively transforming into industry 4.0 environments. Results reveal that the potential of industry
                4.0 is
                underexploited within product design and development, especially in the conceptual stages lacking
                methods,
                tools, and approaches. While later stages of the product development (production planning, ramp-up) have
                received some attention in regards with optimizing production operations, several publications
                acknowledge its
                potential to benefit earlier process stages.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Form giving/styling for nature-inspired designs is a creative problem-solving activity
                that
                involves a rigorous visual analysis of natural forms. In this paper, we attempt to understand the
                ‘designerly’
                way of thinking for products that draw inspiration from nature. For our study, we examine the works of
                Owen
                Jones, Christopher Dresser, Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo, Luigi Colani, and Ross Lovegrove, who are
                internationally

                audio-visual
                material for analysis. Inferences and insights are drawn to suggest methods that may assist novice

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The news of a child being diagnosed with a chronic illness such as cancer, is of-ten
                unexpected
                and can seem devastating. Many families experience a sense of powerlessness in the beginning at the
                prospect of
                dealing with their child’s ill-ness. Research indicates that it can be extremely beneficial for the
                family,
                including the child, to try and understand as much as they can about the condition and its care. This
                helps
                build trust, reduce confusion and anxiety as well as help them feel included in medical exchanges. The
                child is
                also more likely to cooperate with the tests and treatments. Children who do not know about their
                ailment use
                their thoughts to fill in the knowledge gaps and may start to think that they did something wrong or are
                at
                fault. Taking a positive and encouraging approach to educate the child on this matter boosts morale and
                empowers
                the child instead of scaring and stressing them. This is exhibited via design of a demonstration kit
                named ‘Can
                Care Pals’ that uses storytelling and play to help ease the information transfer for the children and
                their
                parents, specifically for children undergoing cancer treatment. The matter is demonstrated through an
                inspiring
                story, narrated using smart and interactive dolls which represent strong and positive characters for
                treatment,
                immunity and cancer. ‘Can Care Pals’ also educates and guides the parents or caregiver through the
                entire
                process with the help of a supported app. Aided with this app the dolls are capable of comforting,
                encouraging,
                setting a routine, dealing with symptoms of the therapy and recording the child’s pain. ’Can Care Pals’
                aims at
                creating a safe, playful and encouraging environment for children fighting cancer.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The present study undertaken within the DesignOBS project, is based on 172 PhD theses
                in Design

                school impact, explore the weight of previous design-focused and non-design doctoral work to develop PhD
                research in Design in the country. The results reveal few connections between doctorates and few
                overlaps

              <p><b>Brand Style DNA in consumer products: decoding strategies from a design perspective</b></p>
              <p>Shoubhik Dutta Roy (MIT Institute of Design) and Wricha Mishra (MIT Institute of Design)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Brands use Style DNA strategies to differentiate from competition and enhance brand
                perception.
                It is, therefore, critical for design professionals to have a clear understanding of these strategies,
                so as to
                be able to deliver the benefits successfully. However, literature available on the subject is found to
                be
                varying in terminology and largely limited to certain product categories and iconic brands. Brand style
                DNA
                concerns the complete portfolio of a brand, but very few researchers have gone to the extent of
                analyzing a
                brand’s product range and comparing it with that of competitors. Moreover, a bias towards the marketing
                and
                psychological perspectives necessitates re-search focused on the design perspective. This paper
                consolidates
                available knowledge into a comprehensive taxonomy, something that does not exist at present. It
                comprises of
                four aspects – parameters of brand style DNA strategies, factors to be considered, evolution over time,
                and
                deconstruction techniques. Further, this study deep-dives into one of the most prominent areas of
                decoding brand
                style DNA strategies – the analysis of explicit design cues. Two existing techniques, namely Design
                Format
                Analysis and 4DD Analysis, are critically examined. A systematic and definitive conceptual framework is
                proposed, that addresses the weaknesses of existing techniques and makes significant improvements
                through
                introduction of image boards with multiple views, standardized design cues, and category-level analysis.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The craft of Shivarapatna is one of the finest stone craftsmanship and has been
                continuing from
                the past 2000 years. The craft is world-renowned and has been categorized in a prime category. The
                sculptures
                are primarily of gods and goddesses and have seen a dip in their market share as well as taking the
                craft into
                the future. The study carries the underlying aspects of Shivarapatna crafts in terms of promoting the
                craft and
                creating a branding identity of the whole craft to get a bigger exposure to gain a new market and have a
                better
                market share. The craft needs to contemporize to be at par with other crafts but the emotional, cultural
                and
                spiritual beliefs are to be taken care of while integrating contemporary design into their product
                range.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>A data analysis method based on artificial neural networks aiming to support
                cause-and-effect
                analysis in design exploration studies is presented. The method clusters and aggregates the effects of
                multiple
                design variables based on the structural hierarchy of the evaluated system. The proposed method is
                exemplified
                in a case study showing that the predictive capability of the created, clustered, dataset is comparable
                to the
                original, unmodified, one. The proposed method is evaluated using coefficient-of-determination, root
                mean square
                error, average relative error, and mean square error. Data analysis approach with artificial neural
                networks is

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The development of Information Communication technology (ICT), decreasing cost of
                mobile phone
                devices and mobile service including internet on mobile has increased their penetration of mobile phone
                and
                internet services across the population including the low-income population. The reach and penetration
                of mobile
                phones can ensure the delivery of a large number of services in a cost effective, fast and seamless
                manner even
                without physical access. This phenomenon has also shown great potential in using the internet and mobile
                as a
                delivery channel for extending the reach of financial services to the marginalised and traditionally
                unbanked
                population. There have been several initiatives and measures, both from the government and other private
                agencies in extending financial services for the economically less privileged.<br />Demonetisation in
                Nov. 2016
                and later the cashless India push by the government has made contactless and cashless transactions, the
                preferred choice of many among the population. Digital wallets became the alternative to cash after
                demonetisation to cope with the cash crunch. Several mobile-enabled financial products and services
                including
                mobile money and mobile payments etc. have been launched since then including BHIM, Paytm, Mobikwik,
                M-Paisa,
                Airtel Payment, Jio money, Google Pay (Tez), etc. However many researchers have reported that Mobile
                financial
                services especially mobile payment/ mobile money has not found the desired acceptance among the large
                section of
                the urban poor and the marginalised sections.<br />The paper present the two studies conducted applying
                the
                User-centered approach conducted as part of the PhD Thesis research and its findings/insights. The first
                qualitative study was conducted to understand and observe the usage pattern of the mobile phone features
                and
                services including mobile internet, social media and mobile financial services. This study was conducted
                in form
                of In-person unstructured interview, and task observations among the 121 sample representing 73 male and
                48
                female in Delhi and NCR region to understand their usage, motivation and barriers in using mobile
                features and
                services and if the literacy serve as a barrier in using the mobile financial services. The second study
                was to
                explore and understand the prerequisites (hardware, software, regulations, etc.), the features offered
                and steps
                to setup/register, use two most popular and used mobile payment/mobile money offerings; BHIM and Paytm.
                If any
                of these serves any barriers in using these services by the targeted urban poor population.<br />The
                findings
                have pointed out the usage pattern of the mobile-based services including mobile payment/mobile money
                among the
                sample. The studies also indicates the factors that influence the usage intention of the mobile
                financial
                services (mobile payment/mobile money) among them as well how BHIM or Paytm supports or offer barrier in
                acceptance and usage amongst the urban poor population.<br />This paper discusses in details the
                research

                (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität
                Magdeburg), Andrea Wolffram (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg) and Michael Schabacker
                (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>With human-centered design becoming more widely implemented within various industries,
                the
                user’s needs are being taken into account more than ever. The user of a product or service has been very
                well
                defined over the last decades. What is often overlooked is the user’s counterpart: the non-user.
                Integrating
                non-users into modern development projects provides great additional value, since addressing their needs
                can
                turn a previously inactive group into new users.<br />First, current definitions of non-users need to be
                compiled in order to analyse and evaluate them within the context of product development. A contribution
                is to
                be made towards creating a comprehensive definition of the non-user that can be applied to product
                development.
                Current literature mixes definitions of non-use with reasons for non-use. An analytical differentiation
                between
                the two needs to be made in order to comprehensively define the non-user and reasons for
                non-use.<br />On the
                basis of the “non-user map” (Augustin et al. 2020), which classifies different types of non-users based
                on
                frequency of use and degree of self-determination, this paper seeks to define and classify the different
                reasons
                for non-use. These reasons can be divided into interconnected groups, that show the relationships in
                between
                each category.<br />With non-users and their reasons for non-use comprehensively defined, proposals for
                their
                integration into product development can be made. With a new concept of the widely used design tool
                “persona”
                (Cooper, 2004), the “non-persona”, now the non-user of a product or service can be included in the
                development
                process as well as the user in order to give a more comprehensive understanding of possible requirements
                for a
                product or service.</p>

              <p><b>Product Semantics : The Emotional Design Language</b></p>
              <p>Lakshay Gaur (Shiv Nadar University) and Subhajit Chandra (Shiv Nadar Univeristy)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This study explores the co-existent nature of emotions and cognition in humans to
                build and
                propose a framework that helps correlate ‘likeability’ and ‘sellability’ of a product by introduction of
                a
                relatively new term – Unique Selling Factor (USF). The framework runs on context-based logical
                correlations
                among its constituents. The aim of this framework is to qualita-tively express the emotional
                characteristics of
                a product. As emotions work along side with cognition, the design attributes of the product under the
                lenses are
                first analysed as per the three levels of our brain’s processing. Each design feature corresponds to the
                processing level based on the con-sumers’ probable preferences to choose that feature in the first
                place. After
                this cognitive breakdown, we further diverge the semantic analysis at emo-tional levels. Each design
                feature
                when stated with the consumers’ probable preference and the cognition level involved, can now help
                develop
                context of the scenario. This context that triangulates the connect between the design feature,
                consumers’
                preference and processing level, plays significant role as the backbone of emotionality in the analysis
                overall.
                To apply the under-standing built, a logical study is done considering a black V-neck T-shirt as the
                product
                under the lenses. For this product we define the likeability, sella-bility and the unique selling
                factor. For
                analysis, we create a feature analysis table that sub-divides the product features first, into its
                design
                characteristics. Second, against these characteristics are explored the probable reasons the consumer
                might have
                had for opting for those characteristics. Third, each reason for the preference for its respective
                design
                characteristic is assigned to its corresponding levels of brain processing. Fourth, for the context
                devel-oped
                so far, we can assign emotions involved. The co-existence of emotion and cognition paves way for this
                product -
                semantic design language. Thus the framework proposed works evidently on emotion and cognition and helps
                provide
                a novel perspective – that of the most significant stakeholder of all – the customer and the people we
                design
                for. The framework follows an eco-systemic approach that provides it with appropriate literature and a
                holistic
                approach.This categorization works on how our minds recognise and categorise objects. Without fining
                objects in
                literal terms we are capable to define their abs or ‘fuzzy’ boundaries. It has been found that contour
                of any
                physical entity is the very first aspect we intuitively and instantly analyse the moment our eyes gaze
                on the
                product. Here, the cognitive process of intuition plays an important role in doing tasks that work on
                qualitative models rather quantitative algorithms. Hence the triangulation of qualitative and
                quantitative
                method describes process of product emotions by developing logical reasoning of product semantics. Such
                grammar
                helps build an emotional and abs language of design that imparts a connection into the interaction or
                the
                product. On this language, design elements can be shaped that help design products or services that can
                be
                valued as emotional works of design.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>How do people with visual impairment see the world? In this literature review based on
                cognitive
                sciences findings, we have analyzed the main concepts used in the human brain's cognitive processes to
                represent
                our perception of the surrounding environment. One of these concepts is mental imagery, which resembles

                multisensory
                design cognition. It can help us understand the designer's cognition process, design better systems for

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Multifunctional designs such as the Swiss army knife, sofa-cum-bed, smartphones, etc.
                are
                commonplace, but there is limited research to assist designers in determining what factors to consider
                while
                designing such products. Therefore, findings from a survey-based empirical study that seeks to
                understand how
                potential users perceive the desirability of multifunctional products in which the functions of two or
                more
                existing products are combined into one product, are presented. The findings from this study can be used
                by
                designers to build better multifunctional designs. The empirical study builds on related theoretical
                work on
                sharing in designs, especially structure sharing and resource effectiveness, where factors identified
                from
                previous work such as relative importance (RI) of the different functions performed by the product, the
                Quality
                of Functions (QoF), and the emergent Negative Functions (NF) in the multifunctional product, are found
                to be
                relevant. The results and insights from the responses to the survey are presented, and the implications

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The discussions in online groups and communities that share a common identity and
                interest can
                provide useful insights into various attributes and behaviors of the group as well as their beliefs and
                thinking. Such discussions may also be useful to make preliminary conjectures and hypotheses about the
                wider
                community they identify with. Accordingly, this paper seeks insights from an extended group chat among
                the
                alumni of a design school of a reputed institute over a logo rebranding exercise commissioned by their
                alma
                mater.<br />An almost collective sense of dissatisfaction among the design alumni with the approved
                rebranded
                logo of their alma mater ensured that the discussion extended over a month, providing a rich volume of
                data and
                discussion to analyze and reflect on. While the situation was somewhat unique because of the sentiments
                attached
                to their alma mater, the range of discussions covered several comments on the outcomes (designs),
                process, and
                people (stakeholders). Therefore, this paper presents a preliminary analysis of the discussion. This
                analysis
                sought to gain insights into their thinking and beliefs, both as individuals as well as a group.

              <p><b>Practices in Bio-Design: Design Research Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration</b></p>
              <p>Assia Stefanova (Newcastle University)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Within the emerging field of bio-design there is a growing need for interdisciplinary
                practice
                and collaboration that enables design with living organisms. To facilitate such work designers often
                venture
                outside of the limits of their own design field and engage with methods, knowledge, and language of
                other
                disciplines. Bio-design collaborations range from fundamental studies to applied research that
                incorporates
                existing knowledge and ideas. The examples presented in this paper are part of the author’s doctoral
                research in
                architecture by creative practice, that include a fundamental study of photosynthetic bio-composite
                materials,
                an applied materials study through the use of fabrication with living organisms and an eco-philosophical
                graphic
                novel based on conversations with scientists. The outlined studies demonstrate, the adoption of
                laboratory
                methods within design practice, the integration of existing scientific work within design and the
                organic
                exchange of ideas through alternative methods of visual communication. The paper explores the
                opportunities and
                limitations of such practices and highlights their importance within the field of bio-design. The
                presented
                studies help define a spectrum of interdisciplinary collaboration in relationship to discipline specific
                skills
                utilized de-pending on design intent and outcome. This paper seeks to highlight the bene-fits of
                knowledge and
                skills transfer through bio-design collaboration, offering a range of possibilities using different
                mediums and
                modes of communication between practitioners of the science and design fields.</p>

                thinking
                strategies based on conditions in Kerala. For the past two consecutive years, Kerala has been inundated
                by
                floods which have had a great impact on every citizen’s mind. Loss of life, property and most
                importantly
                “dreading the next flood” has left an average Keralite wondering if there is an end to this. Is Kerala
                really
                prepared for another flood? Residential construction in Kerala accounts for a huge percentage of its
                existing
                ground coverage. It is everyone’s dream to build their dream home in the best way they could, especially
                in
                Kerala. The paper aims to bring about a useful tool for architects, specifically for flood resistant
                residential
                design catering to Kerala. The paper attempts to make a concise design tool based on regulations and
                local
                knowledge. The tool will be designed to give out a set of concise guidelines to architects based on the
                inputs
                given, which can be easily followed in the design process. The tool will help in building a better
                tomorrow, in
                the context of global warming and increased flooding episodes across the globe</p>

              <p>Ravi Mahamuni (Tata Consultancy Services), Supriya Mantry (Tata Consultancy Services) and Mayur Jadhav
                (Tata

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Well implemented services can have a transformative impact on any organization. The
                implementing
                teams receive service design specifications once the design phase is complete. These specifications
                include
                service blueprints, storyboards, touchpoint guidelines, among many other custom artefacts. Service
                blueprints
                and storyboards are created considering interactions of a service user with various touchpoints in the
                journey.<br />Touchpoints can be broadly divided into human and technical categories. Implementation of
                technical touchpoints, as envisaged by the designer, will bring the experience alive not only for
                service users
                but also for all stakeholders including the service provider. However after the handover of service
                design
                specifications to the implementation team, inconsistencies may often be introduced during development of
                the
                touchpoints. The touchpoints may differ from the designers’ original vision and affect the stakeholders’
                unified
                experience. It is difficult to trace back the root cause of this mismatch. Typically, to mitigate this
                problem,
                the long-term involvement of the service designers is recommended during the implementation phase.
                However, it
                may not always be feasible due to the associated cost and effort. Hence there is a need to bridge the
                gap
                between the service specification and technical specit=fication to reduce the dependency o service
                designers
                during the implementation phase.<br />There is a need to investigate the handover process and the form
                and
                content of the service specifications. For any technical touchpoint, a specification document is created
                before
                implementation. It is derived from service specification artefacts like blueprints, storyboards. The
                completeness and quality of technical specification play an essential role in implementation. In this
                paper, we
                propose a method to convert service specification to technical specification, with a way to evaluate its
                completeness. We scrutinized various technical specification templates available to find various
                segments of the
                document. These segments for the touchpoint were mapped directly or indirectly with elements of service
                specifications. System features and requirement, one of the most significant segments of the technical
                specification was mapped with points of interactions between stakeholders and touchpoint in the journey.
                Hence
                giving a way to trace and validate the service experience by any feature after implementation rollout.
                Mapping
                this extensive technical specification with designers early in implementation makes it rich and

                the

              <p><b>The Influence of Personal traits on Indian Millennial’s Adoption of 3D Printed Fashion Products</b>
              </p>
              <p>Indranil Saha (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad) and Dr. Deepak John Mathew (Indian Institute
                of
                Technology)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Additive manufacturing technology, popularly known as 3D printing, is a contemporary
                method of
                customizing and manufacturing products. The 3D print market is expected to be worth more than $10
                billion by the
                year 2021. The future of fashion aims to make use of 3D printing technology in the manufacturing
                process;
                however, practitioners are still doubtful whether this technology has the potential to revolutionize the
                fashion
                industry. Although 3D printing technology offers benefits to the businesses and production processes,
                whether it
                can replace the present mass production methods is still questionable. Until now, 3D printed fashion is
                studied
                from the perspective of material and technology applications. The perspective and adoption intents of
                the
                consumers are not explored, specifically in the Indian context. Hence, this research aims to study
                possible
                influences of 3D printed fash-ion products’ adoption intention on Indian millennials. Personal traits
                are the
                essential basis of human behaviors that are closely associated with human needs. These personal traits,
                such as
                social, functional, hedonic, and cognitive attributes, are also arguably better predictors of consumer
                behavior
                than demographic or psychographic factors. The current study explores the role of personal traits in
                adopting 3D
                printed fashion products through domain-specific factors such as fashion innovativeness and fashion
                leadership.
                The data were collected from a convenience sample of Indian millennials via an online survey method.
                Research
                findings of this study add to the existing conceptual literature of 3D printing applications in fashion
                and
                guide fashion design practitioners by providing influencing factors of 3D printed fashion adoption among
                Indian
                millennial fashion consumers.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Small and marginal farmers play an essential role in the Indian agrarian economy.
                However,
                climate change, inflation, inadequate supply, volatile market, deterioration of land and water
                resources, rising
                input costs, post-harvest losses along with lack of appropriate technology has led to an agrarian crisis
                in
                recent years. Small and marginal farmers are unable to use modern solutions due to issues like rising
                labour
                costs, lack of capital and unavailability of appropriate technology. Also, as the men migrate from
                villages to
                cities, Indian agriculture is becoming increasingly feminised. Hence, there is an urgent need for
                developing
                sustainable, appropriate, and affordable farm tools which are gender-friendly, effective, and
                efficient.<br />A
                designer needs to understand various parameters for designing and evaluation of solutions to design and
                develop
                appropriate, affordable, context-specific interventions. These parameters range from technical to
                social, and
                the process for developing the parameters is described in this paper. Initially, data from various
                sources were
                collected and represented visually in mind maps with overlays to understand different layers of
                activities,
                existing solutions and needs. These overlays, along with a Design Futures framework, were used as a
                reference
                point to generate parameters which would inform and drive various directions for ideation and evaluation
                during
                the design process.<br />The authors have used the user needs pyramid resulting out of the identified
                parameters
                to generate a design specification for farm implements. The factors used to generate the specification
                consider
                not just the technical aspects but also the socio-economic and cultural aspects.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Due to issues of small land size and dependence on traditional tools and methods,
                small and
                marginal farmers continuously struggle to maintain a balance between the investment towards this
                expensive
                equipment and their crop yield. These issues highlight the need for intervention in the small-scale rice
                farming
                domain.<br />Literature study, along with a discussion with a resource-person from one NGO from the
                western
                region of the state of Maharashtra, was used to gain a preliminary under-standing of on-the-ground
                realities and
                issues affecting small-scale rice farming. The in-formation collected from these sources were then
                mapped to

                authors
                have used the design methods to visualise the rice farming activities and tools used. The map with

                be used as a reliable reference point for generating parameters which affect farm tool design for small

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>By the mid-nineteenth century, the railway had established itself enough to be
                accepted as an
                important party of life in the industrial era, and the railway station took on an increasingly
                representative
                appearance. Architects have amended the industrial aspect of the train sheds through more traditional
                façade
                design and the station buildings are fighting for a place among the league of theatres, museums, and
                city halls.
                Although the architecture and spatial planning have found importance in governance and policies, the
                role of its
                embellishments has been neglected. These are mostly treated monographically, ignoring the context of
                visitors.
                Establishing the diverse iconography that must be developed for the decoration of railway stations is a
                part of
                a larger study to showcase cultural heritage with creativity.<br />For several decades now, cities all
                over the
                world have been applying marketing techniques and increasingly adopting a marketing philosophy to meet
                their
                operational and strategic goals. City marketing has grown into an established field of research and an
                academic
                subdiscipline. This article explores visual design elements of the Kamakhya Railway Station that acts as
                a
                gateway to Guwahati city, Assam for people with the intent of visiting Kamakhya temple. The study
                proposes a
                design for the city map with a focus on tourism and its usage in railway station design. Finally, it
                points to
                areas for further research and exploration.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Living root bridges are an excellent example of the amalgamation of human innovation
                and nature.
                The bridges are grown by methods of tree-shaping using the aerial roots of Ficus Elastica (Rubber fig
                tree/Indian rubber tree), which grows abundantly in the tropical rainforest regions of Khasi hills,
                Meghalaya.
                The practice has been in place for centuries to tackle the issue of crossing robust water bodies. The
                technology
                is not restricted to bridges alone. Ladders, platforms, walkways and even bleachers have been created by
                utilizing the living root methodology. To understand the significance of Living root bridges in the
                communities
                of Meghalaya and their potential to be used as a guiding model for contemporary design practices. The
                paper
                investigates and documents the features of Living root bridges and how they are unique to the indigenous
                context
                of Meghalaya. It also analyses the impact and usefulness to the communities and economic growth through
                domestic
                and international tourism. This is done by studying the ecological, social, cultural and economic
                scenario of
                the region and their association to the living root bridges. The innovation by the local Khasi and
                Jaintia
                people has proven to be an object of marvel for nature-lovers, engineers, designers and everyone alike.
                Their
                superior strength is attributed to their living character and continuous growth over hundreds of years.
                However,
                mass tourism can be seen as posing an imminent threat to these extraordinary structures. The living root
                bridges
                and their underlying attributes can help to reform the contemporary building, engineering and design
                practices
                to become more intertwined with nature for strength and sustainability. Their potential can be explored
                further
                by combining the expertise of multi-disciplinary experts to practically test new developments and
                designs with

              <p>Vimal Krishnan R (Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad), Prasad S Onkar (Indian Institute of
                Technology
                Hyderabad), Alison De Kruiff (Swinburne University of Technology) and Deirdre Barron (Swinburne
                University of
                Technology)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Inspiration is an important stage in conceptual design, wherein designers interact
                with
                different stimuli to generate creative ideas. Various cognitive processes like analogical reasoning have
                been
                described in design inspiration scenarios and have also been mapped to ontologies of cognitive
                psychology.
                However, the emotional processes in design inspiration are not clearly explained through ontological
                frameworks.
                In studies which report the significance of emotion in design inspiration, various aspects of emotion
                tend to
                get conflated. This conflation may lead to inappropriate choices of methods to measure emotion. To
                address this
                gap, this paper adopts the core affect model of emotion to offer a constructivist understanding of
                emotion in
                de-sign inspiration contexts. The components of the core affect model are mapped to aspects of emotion
                reported
                in design inspiration scenarios which involve the use of stimuli. The paper then briefly outlines the
                potential
                of this ontological approach to study emotion in design inspiration. For this, a specific inspiration
                scenario
                is taken wherein a design student, while perceiving stimuli, thinks aloud to denote an emotion. It is
                then shown
                that this utterance could instantiate a detailed multipronged analysis in the framework of the core
                affect
                model, which delineates various constituent parts of emotion such as core affect, affective quality and
                so on.
                These constituents of emotion are broadly linked to different methodological frameworks with which they
                can be
                captured and analysed. The implications of this approach for future design research is also discussed.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the propeller and its noise generation
                are plays
                a focal position in the determination of Radar signature. Because of this detection possibility, the
                usage of
                compact UAV in military or surveillance based applications may chance to reduce drastically. Therefore,
                nowadays
                a huge research are going on the noise reduction techniques in the UAV's propeller, in which propeller's
                profile
                modification technique is primarily reduce the noise generation. But the research on noise reduction is
                failure
                to include the primary consideration, which is aerodynamic parameters such as Lift, Drag, etc. In this
                work
                deals the comparative aerodynamic performance analysis on various modified UAV's propeller, in which six
                conceptual designs of propellers are analyzed. The base propeller and five other profile modified
                propellers are
                used in this work. The finalized fundamental platform of this work is HQ Bull-nose propeller, which
                having 4.5
                inch pitch, 5 inch diameter and have the capability to provide 500 grams average thrust. CATIA, it is an
                advanced modeling tool, which is supported a lot for all the models construction. An advanced CFD
                numerical
                tool, i.e., ANSYS Fluent 16.2 is used in this work for the prediction of aerodynamic performance
                parameters for

              <p>Shekhar Bhattacharjee (National Institute of Design)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Point of discussion started during colour course At NID with B.Des students. In one of
                the
                discussion it was found that in India different languages has different colour names and different
                language has
                slightly different name for same colour. This was discovered when a group discussion was happening on an
                assignment, collection of colour vocabulary in mother tongue.<br />During the time it was came to my
                mind that
                along with the difference in name of a colour, is there any difference in the colour itself also. For
                example,
                colour Orange, is called Narangi, Keshri etc In Hindi and in Bengali it is called Kamala, Kusumi and so
                on. But
                is Kusumi as colour, different from Narangi or Orange? Other way also it can be said that is the word
                Orange
                produces different visual perception of the colour while pronounced than the word Narangi or
                Kusumi.<br />Also
                as dealing with visual art it was always made me feel that word has connection with visual perception.
                Prof V. S
                Ramachandran established the fact that the sound human vocally produces as word has connection with
                visual form
                or shape, it could be other way around also, sound of any pronounced word can bring visuals in mind. (
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjFCaGK7gX8 29/1 /2020 11.04 am.)<br />Prof. Dan Everett argued that
                language is
                consist of Index, icon, and symbols with grammar. Now index, Icon and symbols are also connected with
                visual.
                So, visualization is unavoidable when language comes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFxg5vkaPgk 30/1
                /2020
                5.20 pm)<br />Also, it was felt that different language creates different Visual or Multi sensory
                experiences
                and sensations for the same phenomenon. For example, Bhay (Bengali) Creates different visualization than
                Fear
                (English).<br />It is also assumed that the language, which is been used during zero to five years of
                human
                development can give the deeper appeal because, during the age range most of the cognitive development
                happens,
                which has lifelong impact. (https://www.firstthingsfirst.org/early-childhood-matters/brain-development/
                31/1/2020 4.56 pm)<br />Couple of experiments were conducted to Investigate two assumptions, one was
                ‘name of
                the Same colour in different languages create different visualization of the colour’ and the second one
                was
                ‘name of the Same colour in mother tongue creates different visualization than foreign
                language.<br />Experiments were conducted during the colour course with B. Des and M.Des
                Students.,<br />In
                first experiment colour Orange was given and participants were asked to pronounce the colour name in
                their
                mother tongue. After pronouncing it in mother tongue, whatever colour they had visualized they had to
                paint it
                in a swatch of certain size. A range of orange colour was found.<br />In Second experiment Participants
                were
                asked to take a colour and pronounce it in English and paint the colour which were visualized. Then they
                had to
                pronounce it in mother tongue and paint it. Same colour was visualized and painted differently in
                English and
                mother tongue.<br />The paper is about relation in between language and visualization, particularly
                language and
                colour.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Eco-Design is a product design approach to assess Sustainability through environment
                and
                economy. There are many aspects of Indian craftsmanship which absolutely communicate to existing
                Eco-Design
                principles pertaining to material, production, execution, wastage, environment and sustenance. This
                paper
                investigates the Craftsmanship sectors of Bamboo, Wood, Eri Silk and Brass Metal in Assam of North East
                India
                and compares its attributes to the successful principles of Eco Design.<br />The results suggest that
                there is a
                high possibility of implementing Eco Design applications and design processes in craft sectors because
                there is
                a considerable compatibility between the nascent attributes of craftsmanship and the principles of
                Eco-Design,
                such as high reliability and durability, lower energy consumption, cleaner materials and production,
                possibilities for recycling etc. The segments which have not been addressed yet, such as remanufacture
                and
                packaging, can undergo implementation through design thinking and execution. Technological interventions
                are
                required to bring amendments to the existing processing methods to drive towards principles of
                Eco-Design, and
                therefore, Sustainability.<br />Design via craftsmanship can be effectively positioned as an Indian
                Design
                identity in the evolving modernity. The intersection can deliver an ecologically viable range of
                products to the
                urban market, through which, the Design community can have its efforts calibrated towards the
                repercussions of
                waste management and climate change, along with the friction against the rapidly changing environment.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Crime rates are escalating all over the world, especially in India. Civilians are
                resigned to
                live amidst lethal repercussions of criminal activities that takes place every day around them. Liberty
                is taken
                for granted which may lead to fatal consequences. Personal Safety and self-defense plays a very
                important role
                in such situations. A good design can prevent loss of human life. Personal Safety tools such as Pepper
                sprays,
                firearms, tasers, stun guns, knives, batons etc. are effective non-lethal weapons but they all share a
                common
                flaw. All the above mentioned tools are offensive weapons and can also be misused against the victim.
                They can
                inflict serious injuries, cause blindness, paralysis or even loss of life. As a result, some non-lethal
                weapons
                are banned by law in many countries and their usage is prohibited to even the law enforcement bodies.
                Another
                major drawback is that these products can be taken away by the perpetrator and used against the victim.
                The
                accessibility and use of these products is not very effective under duress. Also the availability of
                these
                product is scarce and limited in terms of variety. A study was conducted to find out if people are aware
                and
                satisfied with existing non-lethal weapons. Triangulation method was used to interpret the collected
                data.
                Questionnaire and interviews were taken to note if people feel safe in their environment on daily basis.
                Field
                visits and interviews revealed a better understanding of the attacker’s psychology and views of the
                administrative authorities were recorded to establish the need for a new concept of self-defense. This
                need
                intensifies as majority of the population feels threatened and helpless for themselves and their loved
                ones
                almost every day of their life. Since defending one’s life supersedes the intent to inflict harm, the
                ideal
                direction would be to develop a defensive device rather than an offensive one. The product will empower
                the
                victim and aid them in neutralizing the attacker so that they are discouraged to pursue the attack
                further. Such
                a solution will be a calculated way of protecting oneself without harming anyone.<br />In an environment
                where
                people live in a constant fear, a new innovation in the form of a device that cannot be misused can save
                many
                lives. A simple solution that acts as a deterrent and requires no skills can be used by all and the
                value of
                human life will be restored.</p>

              <p>Björn Ragnar Kokoschko (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg), Laura Augustin
                (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität
                Magdeburg) and Michael Schabacker (Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The design, development and manufacturing of products inevitably involves
                environmental aspects
                (e.g. material and energy consumption) that lead to negative environmental impacts. The awareness of
                these
                issues enables an understanding of the immediate effects that design and manufacturing have on the
                environment
                and how products can affect the ecosystems around them. We face many problems we can only solve if the
                design of
                products is geared towards ecological requirements. This requires product development to be a holistic
                and
                interlinked process. In this sense the development of a sustainable product must extend its design
                perspective
                beyond product specifications or consumer needs and contribute to a more sustainable environment, from
                conception to disposal.<br />T he different methods and tools in product design partly consider very
                specific
                impact categories of sustainability by analysing the impacts of an already developed product. So far
                there is no
                practical approach to holistic and interlinked product design that sufficiently takes ecological
                requirements in
                early stages of the design process into account. This has been attributed to the extensive and complex
                nature of
                the relevant knowledge landscape, which makes it more difficult for designers to select appropriate
                methods and
                tools. There is a lack of approaches and methodologies for accelerated and optimised application by
                industry
                professionals.<br />In order to minimise the negative environmental effects that grow with increasing
                population
                density, this contribution highlights how designers are supported where to find methods, tools and
                frameworks
                for eco-design as well as how to use them. For this purpose context-sensitive methods shall be
                identified that
                can be integrated in early phases of the design process.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The present study aimed at designing a simple, yet safe transfer assistive device for
                lower limb
                impaired individuals in the context of a developing country. A novel design methodology was adopted by
                combining
                the product design process with the concepts of biomechanics, anthropometry and human dynamics in a
                Human-Machine environment. The first phase of this paper elucidates design conceptualization using
                biomechanics
                in a human-machine environment. The second phase investigates experimental validation of the
                manufactured
                prototype concerning the user’s experience. Inertial parameters and design inputs were extracted from
                this set
                up that helped in the development of the 3D model. To evaluate the present device in terms of user’s
                comfort of
                use and level of physical strain, subjects including 19 healthy students serving as “patients” have
                participated
                in a laboratory-simulated setting. Data was collected based on user’s physiologic effort and rate of
                perceived
                exertion using Heart rate monitoring device (Polar RS 400 heart taster) and Borg’s scale, respectively.
                The data
                were analyzed statistically and revealed that the regression equation for predicting the RPE from HR
                showed
                31.3% of the variance in RPE was predictable from the level of HR. The ANOVA significance also indicates
                the
                model is statistically significant with (p&60#0.013). Similarly, the estimated strain level has computed
                in
                terms of %HRR, and the physical strain averaged over the subjects who performed the task (n = 19) was
                expressed
                in terms of (mean ± SD) %HRR were (16.21±7.64 %) which was a relatively smaller strain level as compared
                to the
                previous research report.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Services must scale up to meet the varying contexts and demands of diverse consumer
                groups,
                especially for global consumers, citizen services and organisational services. To enable services for
                scale, the
                activity of service design must scale up concerned processes, tools, techniques and people. Beyond
                traditional
                design approaches, rather than depending on a handful of designers and stakeholders, we can reap
                benefits of a
                more significant number of people and designers, across regions, and considering a wide variety of
                issues, users
                and methods to inform the design of the services. In this paper, we deliberate on this conversation of
                scaling
                service design by primarily considering the phase of primary research, specifically qualitative user
                research.
                Although qualitative user research is accepted as an academic approach, it is often questioned on the
                grounds of
                validity and practicality of logistics. When considering service design for scale across very diverse
                user
                groups, data saturation may be challenging to achieve with a small number of samples. We argue that it
                is
                necessary to tackle more extensive qualitative studies if we want to scale up designing for services,
                with
                technology as an enabler. We highlight this need for conducting large-scale qualitative studies while
                covering
                theory and critique in literature and propose some of the approaches we have attempted in our service

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The emergence of printing press played an important role to bring national
                consciousness among
                people. Visual arts or design techniques occupies a unique position as a medium of expression in the
                field of
                mass media communication. This paper considered the revolutionary impact of the development of
                mechanical
                reproduction on artistic thinking through the visual communication of modern identity. Mechanical
                reproduction
                has been a source of information and informative, means of communication and entertaining. The medium of
                artistic expression was primarily used as a mean of mass communication or a mode of documentation with
                endless
                repeatability as its chief characteristic, turned India into an ‘iconic society’. This paper focused on
                how

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the past few years, automobile dashboard and its instrument panel are becoming
                increasingly
                complicated as they offer a variety of digitized functionalities such as warning icons. Past re-search
                shows
                that certain automotive warning icon designs could be hard to interpret by drivers. A study was
                undertaken for
                determining the usability of certain standard warning icons in auto-mobile instrument clusters using
                System
                Usability Scale (SUS), and also to investigate the “guessability” of these icons. Here, a set of 20
                standard
                warning icons which are commonly used in new models of Indian cars were selected from ISO 2575:2010 and
                50
                participants were em-ployed to determine the usability and guessability of these icons. Standard designs
                of 2
                car dash-board warning icons namely “Brake Warning Light” and “Tire Pressure Monitoring System” were
                found to be
                problematic. A significant and strong positive correlation was found between the mean guessability score
                and the
                mean SUS score for all the 20 warning icons.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Designing a Healthcare product requires understanding the connection between the human
                element
                and the product.<br />Upcoming medical devices and advancing technologies in healthcare mean nothing
                without the
                interaction between doctors and patients. When a person walks in complaining of an ache, it’s the
                doctor’s job
                to use their knowledge and<br />intuition to tease out details and offer a diagnosis. It’s also the same
                process
                we should use when designing a product for healthcare providers and users.<br />To constantly improve
                and
                deliver a promising healthcare product it becomes significant keeping the stakeholders of
                the<br />healthcare
                system in the loop and validating our findings. Besides complying with desirability, viability, and
                feasibility
                of<br />a healthcare product it is the trustworthiness and comfort that a consumer need in them.
                Healthcare
                products are<br />briefly categorized into three categories based on the period of usage i.e.
                Postoperative,
                Intra-Operative, and Pre -<br />Operative. In all these periods of developing a product needs to comply
                with the
                respective state of mind and bodily<br />condition of the user.<br />Quick Prototyping not only helps in
                manufacturing and processing the development of a new healthcare product but<br />also creates a
                crystal-clear
                picture of the minor and necessary changes to be done. Also, it helps to understand the<br />skepticism
                of the
                user and thus, create new design pathways/concepts.<br />According to Adam Mikolsi in his paper on “6
                methods
                for developing your concepts and minimizing production cost\", it<br />suggests that prototyping should
                make 70%
                of the product development process.<br />SUGAR Global innovation network teaches us “Fail early, fail
                often”,
                this can be achieved by prototyping and correcting<br />our flaws rapidly, before we narrow it down to
                the final
                product deliverable.<br />While working on an academic project for SUGAR Global Innovation Network,
                California;
                catering to post-operative care<br />for patients suffering from Anterior Cruciate Ligament tear we
                adopted and
                invested quality time on prototyping<br />adopting the Stanford Design Thinking methodology. It allows
                testing
                the prototypes in four stages (a)Critical Functional<br />Prototype & Critical Experience Prototype
                (b)Darkhorse
                Prototype (C)Funky Prototype (d) Functional Prototype, each<br />imparting an impact on the succeeding
                prototype.<br />Prototyping on each stage was validated with users with various forms of prototypes,
                inclusive
                of physical/tangible<br />prototypes, concepts of smart wearable with automized voice, virtual and
                augmented
                reality concepts and user<br />interface-based prototypes. In this manner, it was easy to understand
                what works
                and what does not, doubts and concerns were raised by doctors, caregivers and users and also these
                prototypes
                became a medium to get to the real needs of users.<br />Insights we gained via these prototypes were
                used to
                finalize the features, decide the products functioning and plan its<br />manufacturing process with
                proper
                dynamics of the product and human interaction maintained. The final product –Exor,<br />is an
                application linked
                wearable to establish a strong connection between the doctors, patient, physiotherapist and
                the<br />caregiver
                which enabled tracking of the recovery progress and provide a customized solution to patients needs
                while<br />recovering from ACL.</p>

              <p>Suhani Arora (Symbiosis Institute of Design) and Aditi Deshpande (Symbiosis Institute of Design)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Interior design as a discipline places humans at the heart of the process and has an
                underlying
                commitment to inclusivity. The British Standards Institute (2005) defines inclusive design as: ‘The
                design of
                mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably
                possible
                ... without the need for special adaptation or specialised design [1].’ Inclusive design embraces
                diversity and
                enables cohesion among age groups, ethnicities, genders as well as mental and physical abilities. In the
                context
                of the Indian scenario, however, inclusive design is not incorporated into mainstream design. Thus, many
                public
                spaces remain inaccessible to a large chunk of the population - including the elderly, people with
                temporary,
                situational and permanent disabilities among others. Though there are government bodies entrusted to
                formulate
                guidelines for making certain buildings barrier free, the ground rules are silent on the implementation
                of
                accessible design in public spaces and built environments. This study aims to address the need for
                inclusivity
                in designing public spaces and proposes an interior design model that can be accessed by diverse
                individuals and
                communities.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>At the undergraduate level, many students studying product design often focus on the
                visual and
                tactile aspects of the design process. Those students inclined towards a wider perspective with respect
                to a
                desire to also focus on the functional, and strength aspects of products, may need a framework to
                understand how
                a design moves from an idea to a product. This study, through the example of designing a bicycle (for
                road use),
                provides a study on how undergraduate students could be engaged to better understand certain elements in
                the
                design of a tangible product. (1) Form, function and strength are key elements of any design which needs
                to be
                linked with the user. (2) Trade-offs of various types are needed at every stage of a design process. (3)
                The
                tools (including computing software) used are easily available to students at no charge. Product needs
                to be
                safe, efficient, attractive and comfortable. Its complexity, in terms of mechanics and mathematics, is
                provided
                at levels where a ‘high-school student’ who has studied mathematics and physics, with some training in
                mechanics

                them,
                such as ‘color theory’. This, and other studies of similar nature, focused on the incorporation of
                ‘applied
                sciences’ more intimately with product design courses, at undergraduate levels, might help graduating

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>A meme is a component of a culture or system of behaviour passed from one individual
                to another
                by imitation or other non-genetic means. Now-a-days, memes are predominately observed in social media
                like
                Facebook, Whats-app etc. Memes communicates various messages either directly or indirectly in a codified
                manner.
                This is a new language of communication, sometimes viral in nature. Although the memes are used for
                sharing
                social messages, strategies for brand communication using memes are less explored. Memes has potential
                to evoke
                responses in human brain and activates emotions. Therefore, objectives of this paper are to analyse the
                effect
                of different design elements used in memes on emotional responses and to demonstrates few strategies for
                brand
                communication using memes. A total of 20 memes were analysed to identify design elements such as
                character
                images (human, animal, emoticons etc.), taglines, dialog cloud, logo etc. which helps in composition of
                memes.
                Later, the level of emotion generated by memes were measured using Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale.
                It was
                observed that character image and taglines are most effective elements that are evoking different types
                of
                emotions among participants. After that, a minimalistic neurodesign strategy for brand communication has
                been
                developed for effective brand communication using these design elements for memes. It was observed that
                there
                are potential to develop memes for brand communication based on emotional responses.</p>

                support to counter women's breast motion and this leads to back aches and physical discomfort with the
                straps
                digging into the shoulders of the user. With the current generation of Indian women tending towards
                western
                attire, the bra needs to be a perfect fit.<br />A complicated wear by itself, women finds it difficult
                to find
                the right size owing it to each women's body being different from one another, as well as, the
                manufacturing
                defects and the wrong measuring techniques applied. This causes a majority of them to wear the wrong
                size
                throughout their lifetime. Interviews were conducted to understand the difficulty level of wearing the
                bras,
                choosing the right size, type and problems faced with regular usage. The data collected was analysed
                Qualitatively with grounded theory approach.<br />Moreover, the availability of various styles, fits and
                sizes
                of brassieres further confuses the consumer from choosing the right fit for them. Usually they buy
                multiple
                brassieres for several occasion. As a result, more brassieres are ending up in the landfill contributing
                to the
                fact that the apparel industry is a leading cause for global warming. The purpose of this study is to
                explore
                the need for an accurate fitting bra which is comfortable and supports breast movement. Throughout
                history women
                have been made to feel insecure about their bodies, not accept it for what it actually is and further
                inculcating self- doubt. Hence there is pressing need of developing a product which molds itself to take
                the
                size, shape and form of the breast tissue thereby making the user feel less body conscious and more
                confident.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Seating system for handloom weaver need appropriate height from floor and distance
                from treadle
                and sley handle, having similarity to the tailor working in a sewing machine. Handloom weaver need to
                work by
                their hand and leg simultaneously in a regular dynamic pattern for long time. It is difficult to weave
                by
                different weavers having different body dimensions but seating on a system that is same for all.
                Currently,
                weavers are using stool or a fixed bench as the seating system for weaving. Therefore, some weaver weave
                in
                awk-ward posture that causes occupational health issues over time. Therefore, it is very important to
                have a
                proper adjustable seating system with weaver’s reachability to handle for beat-up motion and to paddle
                in the
                treadle for shedding motion. A field study was carried out in Sualkuchi and mega hand-loom cluster at
                Sivasagar
                in the state of Assam, India to understand the health issues associated with the seating system and to
                find out
                regarding ex-isting seating system used by the weavers. This paper deals with the positive impact
                through design
                intervention and development can have on the wellbe-ing of handloom weavers if a new seating system
                considering
                anthropometry, physical ergonomics and operational factors is made available to them. An al-pha and beta
                physical prototype model was fabricated with anthropometric data considering Indian men and women.
                Simulation
                was carried out with both lower and higher percentile manikin in CAD tool to get the adjustment range
                required

              <p><b>Effect of different root canal filling materials in endo-perio lesions: Design and computational
                  analysis</b>
              </p>
              <p>Anupam Purwar (ISB Hyderabad, IISc Bangalore) and Pragya Pathak (M. S. Ramaiah University of Applied
                Sciences)

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Dental problems are mostly multifactorial in nature and, thus difficult to diagnose
                and treat. A
                tooth infection which leads to degeneration of pulp and subsequent loss of tooth vitality is called an
                endodontic lesion. Whereas, a disease affecting the supporting structures of tooth such as bone/ligament
                is
                known as periodontal lesion. When an infection is identified with both endodontic and periodontal
                involvement,
                it is termed as endo-perio lesion. Endo-Perio Lesion (EP) is a complex disease entity which involves the
                tooth
                structure as well as the supporting periodontium. This study was conducted with an aim to assess the
                effect of
                different root canal filling materials on different classes of Endo-Perio Lesions (Simon’s
                Classification, 1972)
                using computational modeling. Thus, enabling the clinician in making an informed decision for treatment
                planning
                of Endo-Perio Lesions.<br />In the present work, mandibular molar human tooth with lesion(damage to
                tooth/surrounding tissue) has been precisely modeled in consultation with a clinician(Dentist). Then,
                four
                different finite element models representing different types of EP lesions were developed. Next, finite
                element
                models were validated with experimental data for a normal tooth under a defined (300N) masticatory load.
                Highly
                refined structured mesh with high fidelity second-order elements was generated and ANSYS was used to
                perform the
                structural-analysis. It was observed that stresses at the root apex increased with an increase in
                dimension of
                lesion. However, filling of the root did not affect stress distribution. MTA-based filler creates more
                stress
                when there is periodontal involvement or a true combined lesion. This is in accordance with a clinical
                study,
                which reported better sealing ability of gutta percha in comparison to MTA [1]. Biodentine as filler has
                not
                been investigated for its performance in a simulated study so far. However, Biodentine was suggested as
                an
                alternative to MTA and has better regenerative capacity due to its bio-active nature[2][3]. In this
                perspective,
                our study provides clinical inputs to dentists regarding use of Biodentine as filler.<br />Thus, a
                comprehensive
                engineering investigation has been carried out in close consultation with a clinician to determine
                prospective
                fillers for dental ailments. Such cross disciplinary work involving a design engineer and a clinician
                also
                demonstrates the importance of collaborative research for getting meaningful design insights in
                biomedical
                sciences. The insights from this finite element based investigation is being used currently for
                therapeutic
                purpose by clinicians.<br />References:<br />1. Vizgirda, P.J., Liewehr, F.R., Patton, W.R., McPherson,

                by
                focusing on its chromatic aspects. In this paper, a case study of Majuli, a river island of Brahmaputra
                river
                has been taken for research. Majuli has 22 Satras, the religious institutions which came into existence
                after
                Neo Vaishnavite movement lead by Sankaradeva in 16th century. These satras are center for Majuli’s

                arts and handicrafts. They play a very crucial role in Majuli’s history and culture. The present study
                was done
                by collecting visuals and handicraft articles using primary and secondary research methods. An

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The present paper aims to redesign a walking aid for the elderly through user-centric
                design
                research approach. The study involved 12 elderly volunteers. During the research detailed observation
                has been
                carried out in the area of the daily activities of the elderly, in their real environment with assistive
                devices
                and interaction with other objects using ethnographic research method. Users’ problems and preferences
                towards
                assistive devices were also studied. It was found from the pilot study that the existing walkers make
                the
                elderly feel psychologically dependent and disabled. Many elderly per-sons found it shaky while using.
                This lead
                to non-use or abandonment of the walker, though medically advised. Therefore, this study focused on
                redesigning
                of walker to address the above issues. The designing criteria were derived from the observations and
                interviews
                with stakeholders, concepts were developed, prototypes were made and user tested, prior to arriving at
                the final
                design.<br />During prototyping and material exploration, indigenous natural material like rattan cane
                was used
                to design the walker with additional features like bottle holder, newspaper holder, mobile phone holder.
                User
                trials indicated the advantages of the rattan walker -like easier handling, faster gait speed due to 16%
                lighter
                in weight and aesthetically pleasing appearance. There was an increase in the gait speed of the users
                using
                rattan cane walker as compared to the conventional walking frame. The psychological effect of feeling
                disabled
                was significantly reduced with the new design as observed during the study. The study shows the
                possibility of
                designing user-centric walker using rattan cane walker for the elderly in India.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Organized assortments of photographs have given birth to the method of photogrammetry
                which has
                earlier helped geologists in topographically mapping terrain and landscapes. Photogrammetry is a
                technique of
                measuring from photographs. It is usually associated with the making of maps from aerial photographs.
                When the
                same logic is set as an algorithm, it helps the software yield an even more accurate topographical
                product, but
                now with the additional capability of 3d projections. This can, in turn, be used to create photo
                accurate 3D
                models of any building, object, landscape desired. Along with technologies like virtual reality,
                photogrammetry
                can enable a viewer to be present in a digitized landscape that can be developed to look close to the
                original.
                This paper documents how the above set of technologies were used to virtually archive the monuments of
                Qutb
                Shahi tombs in Hyderabad. The process included photogrammetry, point cloud creation, UV mapping, texture
                modeling, mesh generation, etc. Thereafter, a digital setup of it was made and displayed through virtual
                reality. The result was a tangible, virtual land-scape of the Qutb Shahi tombs, where the viewer could
                digitally
                navigate and see the monuments up close. The built artifact was then tested in a pilot study (n=35) for
                its
                engagement with high school students as a tool for education in the classroom. The early results of the
                respondents have been positive in adopting VR exploration of historical monuments as a supportive tool
                for
                education. The future scope of evaluating this setup includes more exhaustive testing in schools of
                India.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Despite the digital age, and Internet of Things, bringing shopping to the comfort of
                one’s
                living rooms, at the click of the mouse, lingerie shopping, in India, however, has not been able to
                change the
                prevalent mind set of women. Women in India, we find, have stuck to the time tested traditional mode of
                physical
                visits to their favourite shops. The reasons primarily being to physically try them on and avoid the
                cumbersome
                process of online returns.<br />Through this study, we, the authors, seek to help women overcome their
                inherent
                inhibitions, elevating their offline shopping experience. This has been arrived at through a set of user
                centric
                design methods, addressing the issues confronted by women during shopping.<br />In the course of the
                study, we
                found that women predominantly spent much of their time a) picking brassier styles, b) checking
                brassiere sizes
                and c) closeted in trial rooms, before making their final purchases, if any.<br />The study, has evolved
                a
                concept, which optimises the search for lingerie in stores, saves frequent visitation to trial rooms
                and,
                facilitates brands understand better customers’ trial choices and purchasing patterns. The inherent
                benefits of
                the proposed solution and future scopes for possible adoption have also been detailed in the study.</p>

                changes to the
                design of marketed products or systems in order to remain competitive. The accelerating pace of
                technological
                development fosters these changes, which can lead to the appearance of obsolete components, technologies
                or
                system functions. It is now accepted that obsolescence occurs because of the difference between the life
                cycle
                of the components and the life cycle of the system that incorporates them.<br />The resolution of the
                consequences due to obsolescence, whether proven or predicted, can have a significant impact on the
                architecture
                of the system. Indeed, due to couplings and dependencies, modelled in the system architecture, the
                consequences
                of obsolescence rarely remain confined. They can then spread gradually throughout the system. System
                architects
                and product designers must therefore be able to propose architectures that are resilient to
                obsolescence. In
                other words, they should be able to make design choices that, even when there is a risk of obsolescence,
                ensure
                continuity of functionality with the expected performance and within constraints.<br />This work
                consists in
                proposing modeling of the system architecture using probabilistic graphs. These models offer the
                possibility to
                study various design configurations and to determine their consequences on the performance and
                functional
                requirements of the system. We propose simulations of different design scenarios in the presence of
                obsolescence. The objective is to qualify the resilience of the system under different design
                alternatives. A
                set of numerical experiments will be conducted to identify the most resilient design. This approach will
                be
                illustrated by a case study from a weather forecasting system. A discussion of the results and
                conclusions will
                conclude the paper.</p>

              <p>Surbhi Pratap (IIT Delhi) and Jyoti Kumar (IIT Delhi)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>India is the world's largest exporter of HCI products. However, limited research is
                available on
                the HCI design processes adopted in the Indian industry. This paper reports findings from in-depth
                interviews
                with 25 Indian HCI design team leads on the design processes followed in the industry and the
                competencies
                expected from design professionals. One of the key findings from the interviews suggests that the
                industry
                expects a graduate to have an understanding of the business value of the design processes adopted for a
                given
                problem. It is also expected that entrants have knowledge of different types of HCI design processes
                relevant to
                specific organizations like agile sprints, lean processes etc. Further, for each of the different design
                processes adopted by the industry, the specific core skills are expected to be present in the new
                professional
                in order to work seamlessly in the industry. Skills like stakeholder engagement ability, sprint
                usability
                testing, time management, user research techniques, usage of appropriate terminologies in design
                communication,
                co-creation ability with stakeholders of different expertise etc. are what the industry expects from new
                HCI
                professionals. The findings of this study have curricular, pedagogical and strategic relevance for both
                HCI
                academics and industry.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The vast intervention of CAD tools and the ubiquitous availability of computers have
                changed the
                culture of product design and have given birth to a new generation of engineers and designers. It has
                become a
                necessity in today’s fast-moving technology-driven world and an integral part of the designer’s work
                environment. Initially, the application of CAD was mainly restricted to later stages of design, but in
                recent
                years, it has seen increased attention in the idea generation stage.<br />The paper illustrates an
                exploratory
                study conducted with five professional product designers who were given a design task to be performed in
                a
                limited time. The data used for the analysis was the visual data recorded during the design exercise and
                verbal
                data from the interviews. The visual data was recorded with the help of a video camera and desktop
                recording
                software. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to collect supportive data for the
                analysis and were audio-recorded. The video recording of the whole activity was transcribed and
                tabulated and
                occurrences of study parameters were mapped visually. This also helped establish a method to analyze a
                design
                activity with the visual mapping of study parameters. Supportive verbal data from the interview helped
                qualify
                some of the findings and cover the missing points that were difficult to identify in the time-bound
                exercise or
                through observation.<br />The qualitative analysis of the study helped identify visualization as the
                strongest
                enabler offered by the use of CAD in the early idea generation stage. It also indicated the other
                enablers as
                confidence building, faster process and ease of prototyping. The most evident barrier identified through
                the
                study was circumscribed thinking. Circumscribed thinking occurs when ideas get limited or affected by
                the skill
                level of the designer (Robertson and Radcliff, 2009). The study also throws light on how CAD is used in
                the
                process when the design brief requires functional or problem-solving exploration versus formal
                exploration. It
                was observed that during formal explorations, considerable time was spent on exploring how to model,
                leaving
                lesser time for design exploration and decision. It was also observed that during CAD modeling more time
                was
                spent on details and less on the overall design.<br />The study helped understand how designers
                accommodate CAD
                in their exploratory process in combination with other tools like sketching and physical modeling. It
                strengthens the view that CAD has become an integral part of the design environment and is extensively
                used even
                in the idea generation phase of design.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Around 800 maternal deaths occur every day from preventable causes related to
                pregnancy and
                childbirth. A majority of these deaths are caused due to pregnancy-related complications and occur in
                low-resource settings. To improve the current situation of maternal healthcare in rural areas, this
                paper
                proposes an IoT based solution that monitors the vital signs of a pregnant woman and her foetus. At a
                socio-systemic level, the solution ensures communication of the vital data across relevant
                stakeholders(e.g.
                healthcare professionals, family members, and others), thereby ensuring timely intervention in case of
                abnormalities. Several unmet needs and pain points of pregnant women were identified across the
                antenatal,
                intrapartum and postpartum stages of pregnancy from surveys, interviews, and literature, based on which
                a list
                of requirements was formulated. Ideas were generated against the finalized design brief and preliminary
                evaluation was conducted to filter the ideas. Concepts were then explored from the set of viable ideas
                using
                different design methods like relational mapping, bundling, and mash-ups. The proposed design seeks to
                reduce
                morbidity and prevent maternal deaths through the facilitation of timely medical intervention, by
                connecting
                various stakeholders involved at the time of pregnancy.</p>

                Proper use of imagery is crucial for raising social awareness. Consequently, one of the government's
                primary
                reform initiatives revolves around spreading awareness on various social issues. Since im-age or

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>A study of packaging for three different types of sustainable domestic products was
                conducted to
                understand the design strategies by existing brands and the consumers’ perception about the same. The
                objective
                of the study was to know if all the additional values of a product of such kind are effectively
                communicated
                through their packaging. This study utilises Product Semantics as a tool to analyse the packaging design
                at two
                broad parameters of the conceptual framework; Packaging Semantics and Branding Semantics; encompassing a
                range

                graphics

                communication of
                the values of sustainable products with the existing design strategies. New strategies were then devised
                to
                design packaging for the three different types of products to overcome the shortcomings in the existing
                strategies.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Lightweighting is one of the key focus areas in the automotive industry. It continues
                to be in

                While
                the objective of lightweighting is similar in both ICE and EV, the differences in the product
                architecture of EV

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Autonomous vehicles are starting to become a reality. In the not so distant future,
                streets are
                expected to be populated with these intelligent autonomous beings ferrying passengers alongside human
                driven
                vehicles and pedestrians. The bulk of research today seem to focus on setting up the required software
                and
                hardware systems, alongside policies and transportation infrastructure. A review of autonomous vehicle
                developments show that the technologies in progress today aim to create a functional autonomous vehicle
                service
                towards the creation of a network of artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making informed choices
                when
                performing their work, and adapt to the needs of their passengers. A gap is seen to exist in the realm
                of the
                vehicle to passengers interface. This calls for research in developing capabilities in social
                transactions that
                are more familiar to human beings, taking cues from natural conversations and body language
                signals.<br />This
                is because autonomous vehicles not only need to perform navigational duties, but also need to
                communicate,
                respond and reciprocate in a social manner. According to the authors, this would give the AI the dignity
                they
                deserve when performing their functions. This paper proposes a framework for future communication
                between
                autonomous vehicles and humans, with a focus on the working relationship between the vehicle and its
                passengers
                taking references of the communications theory related to human to human interactions, extrapolating to
                human to
                AI interaction within the autonomous vehicle.</p>

              <p>Rukmini Dahanukar (Nirmiti)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>As artifacts of popular culture, banknotes signify more than just tokens of payment.
                Banknotes
                are at the heart of our exchanges and interactions. They are omnipresent and ubiquitous. Circulating for
                more
                than 300 years now, they bear witness to our everyday lives, our possessions, our stories and our
                memories-
                close to our hearts and deep in our pockets. With galloping technological advancement, on-going
                additions to
                payment gateways and alternate global currencies; banknotes would seem to be following the path of the
                dodo. In
                fact, it is just the contrary!<br />The last decade has seen a growth of 175% of the US Dollar bills and
                around
                190% of the British pound notes; even the relatively nascent Euro hit a staggering 200% increase in note
                circulation!<br />With counterfeiters relentlessly at their heels; banknotes; substrates adorned with
                mind-boggling artworks integrating constantly updated security technology into production techniques;
                ceaselessly need to stay ahead; befitting the adage, “back to the future;” perhaps like no other product
                design
                or innovation.<br />The size- restricted, the medium- paper, recently polymer, two-dimensional and two
                sided,
                the method- printing, foiling and special security technologies; not much has changed over the past
                three
                centuries considering the influx and constant bombardment of inventions leaving most products and
                practices
                obsolete or redundant! But not this medium of exchange. That is exactly what makes the banknote and its
                design
                so extraordinary and challenging!<br />Apart from the usual, mundane exchange; our interactions with
                banknotes
                run deep. They are experienced and consumed by our senses; even if less apparent and more subliminal.
                Seeing the
                magnificent and indigenous artworks, feeling the raised and intaglio impressions, hearing the flutter
                and
                folding (the crushing sounds are tests for real versus counterfeit notes); they have an extremely
                personal
                relationship with each of us on a daily basis. To make their design decisions further complex; they are
                also
                handled by machines regularly. Optical and magnetic sensors to assist the multiple interfaces and
                technology
                need to embedded in the notes for effective exchange. Banknotes are thus, part of an elite group of
                products
                that are handled both by men and machines. And as far as the quantum of exchange is concerned; they
                securely

              <p><b>Design of Bamboo Shelter Kit For Post-disaster Temporary Shelter Response</b></p>

                Institute of

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Shelter Aid is an integral part of Humanitarian Aid in post-disaster situations. The
                built
                environ-ment is the most affected sector in the rapidly increasing events of natural and man-made
                disas-ters. In
                these scenarios, sustainable design solutions need to address the loss of habitat and dis-placement.
                North-Eastern part of India is very vulnerable to natural disasters primarily flood, earthquake and
                landslide
                and annually over a lakh of people are displaced. People in the rural areas in this region reside in
                Bamboo
                Houses. Recent explorations of Bamboo as a material in contemporary architecture suggests an
                environmental
                stratagem towards achieving sustainability in the built environment. While, ecological considerations,
                social
                and cultural impact establishes the need for a form of architecture that is flexible, lightweight in
                construction. This study looks into the lifecycle of post-disaster emergency shelters with an ecological
                perspective to determine the critical aspects of design, material sourcing, manufacturing, delivery and
                disposal
                in an envi-ronmental friendly way possible. Further, this study attempts to design a post-disaster
                temporary
                shelter kit to establish the crucial characteristics of Bamboo Architecture that make it successful. The
                design
                decisions based on Bamboo elements with partial prefabricated and portable compo-nents show that mobile
                bamboo
                buildings are feasible, and can fulfil many different roles and are economically viable to build and
                operate in
                post-disaster situations. The study concludes with a recommendation for further iterations of the
                shelter kit
                towards sustainable recon-struction in post-disaster situations.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Additive manufacturing is expected to bring about the next industrial revolution. With
                depleting
                resources, additive manufacturing, with its zero waste manufacturing approach seems promising. The
                recent
                developments in composite design and manufacturing goes hand in glove with this development. However,
                our
                knowledge of the behavior of these structures under various loading conditions and profiles is still not
                completely understood. As a result, this method of manufacturing has not found its way into many
                engineering
                applications. Furthermore, the behavior of additively manufactured composites is different from their
                other
                counterparts. Mechanical properties, need to be determined if additive manufacturing is to truly take on
                other
                manufacturing processes. This work highlights an experimental procedure to determine the elastic and
                tensile
                properties of Kevlar-reinforced nylon composite. Thermal Gravitmetric Analysis (TGA), has been performed
                to
                determine the volume fraction of fiber and matrix components. A relationship between the nylon raster
                layers and
                the Kevlar fiber was also checked using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Samples of this composite
                with
                varying Kevlar-nylon layer ratio have been additively manufactured based on ASTM D3039 standards. A
                model to
                compute the elastic and tensile properties of 3D printed Kevlar reinforced nylon polymers is presented.
                In order
                to determine ratio of load borne by the Kevlar and nylon, a rule of mixtures model was used. The model
                demonstrates the relation between volume fraction and load bearing capacity of the constituents of the
                composite
                can indeed be fit into the rule of mixtures model that is used on conventionally manufactured
                composites. This
                work focusses on loading the samples only in the print direction. This model will give users a deeper
                understanding of how additively manufactured composite samples behave under loading. Moreover, it will
                facilitate the process of design for additive manufacturing.</p>

                (Department of
                Design, School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Visual media, an essential medium of political communication in modern democracies,
                has been a
                critical part of political campaigns across the world for more than a century. The first uses of visual
                media
                for political communication was in the late 19th century when political parties employed multimodal
                (containing
                both textual and pictorial information) posters for election campaigns. World War I accelerated the use
                of
                political posters by governments as tools of propaganda for their war efforts. Since then, political
                communication through visual media has evolved and now includes billboards, television commercials, and
                social
                media posts along with election posters.<br />In the contemporary context, the usage of such modes of
                political
                communication is not limited to political parties and governments but are also being used by broader
                stakeholders in democracies. Members of civil society are increasingly using visual means of political
                communication for various causes, including expression of dissent against their governments and those in
                positions of power. For such kind of use and users, there lies an opportunity for developing a framework
                for
                designing effective visual communication.<br />Through analysing historical and contemporary visual
                political
                communication, this research develops a framework to frame parameters for designing effective new
                political
                communication in a visual medium (particularly in the form of posters).<br />At its foundation, this
                framework
                consists of an understanding on three levels. First, the syntactic includes the choices made regarding
                framing,
                usage of colour, usage of iconography, type selection, etc. Second, the semantics, i.e., the meaning
                associated
                with the imagery and the textual/verbal content of the communication. Third, the pragmatics, which looks
                at the
                imagery and textual/verbal content in the political context of time and space. Further, it looks into
                dimensions
                such as the communicator of the message, the intended recipients, and the desired effect the
                communication. The
                variety of parameters contributes to objectify otherwise subjective political communications.<br />The
                research
                deals with a broad landscape of visual culture to empower the values of democracy. Through a historical
                and
                contemporary understanding of related visual culture, it enriches the literature resolution. The purpose
                is to
                develop and design a product for prospective users and enable them to design their unique political
                communication like posters and digital campaigns.</p>

                Technology Kharagpur)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Recent urbanization trends have skewed a balance distribution within a system of
                cities in a
                nation. According to the report of the United Nations (2015), 54% of the world’s population has
                continued to
                reside in urban areas and, it will soon be 66% by the year 2050. Rapid expansions of the city
                territories and
                population have continued to make the distribution of city-systems imbalanced. Compared to the cities in
                the
                developed countries, cities and their constituent urban spaces of developing countries are struggling to
                retain
                their identity. Mosaics of urban spaces are thus becoming an unmanageable complexity depleting the
                possibility
                of a liveable city fabric.<br />Cities like Kolkata, which has a colonial past, is striving hard to
                retain and
                balance adequate infrastructure to support the needs of the incoming population from the neglected
                hinterland.
                On the physical, environmental and cultural fronts, the continuous pace of struggle has destabilized an
                acceptable yardstick of the urban experience. Hence, a gap has widened between liveable urban designs,
                on the
                one hand, and a balanced distribution of facility and infrastructure on the other hand. A consequent
                sense of
                disjointedness is physically evident and therefore, normatively detrimental. To cope with the present
                scenario
                and secure good complementarity between the two, organizing principles of space design and urban
                engineering of
                infrastructure are needed to be brought together. Thus the paper aims at earmarking a process of
                balanced
                regeneration, based on the application of principles of complementarity in urban design and urban
                engineering.
                The study has underscored a re-envisioning of urban regeneration practices, suggesting a paradigm shift
                from a
                standpoint of ‘either –or’ to a liveable principle of complementarity.<br />To explore the principles of
                complementarity, the paper explores two areas of Kolkata, i.e., area around RabindraSadan and Saltlake
                City
                centre area. The former one is the most prominent cultural node, housing Victoria Memorial, representing
                the
                architectural brilliance of the British colonial era. On the other hand, Saltlake city-center area is a
                famous
                cultural, entertainment zone. Both the areas exemplify strong tangible (technical) and intangible (art
                and
                normative dimension) heritage, having strong physical as well as cultural connotations. But, skewed
                urban design
                practices have caused inequitable access to the stakeholders and therefore, hinder performance towards
                public
                well-being.<br />Hence, the paper has attempted to best approach the principle of complementarity rather
                than
                exploring the constituent parameters of the two, i.e., urban design and urban engineering in isolation.
                The
                study has arrived at an integrated toolbox based on required technological (tangible) and artistic
                (intangible)
                Elements of Design, to devise stepwise analyses of bringing the complementarity between the two design
                elements,
                i.e., one, action plans and possibilities of urban regeneration to induce happiness and wellbeing two,
                experience of space. Finally, the paper attempts to establish the principle of complementarity of
                technical and
                artistic elements of design for sustainable urban regeneration. The paper, therefore, tries to establish
                a new
                framework for urban regeneration practices, processing a paradigm shift away from a conventional
                standpoint of
                ‘either-or’ to the principle of complementarity.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Existing New Product Development (NPD) methods are specification driven; where product
                specifications are typically made before prototyping starts. The existing method does not allow enough
                space for
                modification because of the association of sunk cost. Hence, the prototype driven specification would
                enhance
                New Product Development with better prototype experience. But the prototype driven approach does not
                have
                structured tools and methods to foster. Hence, it is very difficult to introduce and practice in design
                education. Systematic literature review had been done to identify the drivers, principles or guidelines
                and
                support tools in prototyping and prototype driven new product development process. A structured and
                sequential

                may
                foster the emergence of proto-type driven new product development from design education perspective.
                This state

                worked on
                a pilot project, which was presented to the Ministry of Micro-Small Medium Enterprises (MSME),
                India.<br />The
                focus of the project was to understand the challenges faced by a non-organized business or small
                business trades
                ranging from tea vendors, vegetable vendors, etc., How design interventions can bring an improved 'value

                colours and textures around them. We attempted to address the research and design objectives by
                transforming
                initial ideas through a new learning tool based on the representation of the visual forms of Gond
                painting
                tradition of Madhya Pradesh.<br />The design process involved a series of field study in nearby private
                schools
                to realise the apathetic gap towards art-craft in pedagogy. We employed the Gond painting and its
                interpretation
                to develop a visual language, motifs and medium in the problem-context. The ideation included creating
                different
                artwork. It enquired how the process can be made easy and fun for students considering purposes of
                creativity,
                education and self-learning. We tested initial concepts with ten students of standard third to fifth.
                Post-conceptualisation, we developed prototypes and further refined it through beta user testing with
                children
                by organising a workshop on the Gond painting by a prominent Gond artist with thirty students from
                different
                schools from the city. Based on the insights and feedback received, another series of additions and
                considering
                the pragmatics of production, the look of the product, and children's preference, we made final
                refinements. The
                process proved that fun and utility product outcome is an essential element in designing for children
                learning
                experience.<br />The designed product, Dots and Lines: a learning kit on Indian Folk and Tribal Art
                inspired
                activities for Kids, forwards the indigenous design language. It comprises stories and life forms which
                not only
                provoke the creative interest of a learner but also informs her towards the cultural aspects of India's
                vernacular art forms. The design attempts to promote the creative capacity of children and increase
                access and
                engagement in the art and craft activity books of the primary class by providing quality participatory
                arts and
                promoting Indian folk and tribal art. As the human impulse to paint is related to the need to
                communicate,
                express and make sense of the world around, here the users, children, will understand the value of
                indigenous
                craft and its application.</p>

                Diotima Basu (Biswa Bangla Marketing Corporation Limited)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The concept of androgynous or gender-neutral fashion is known for its distinctive
                attribute that
                blends both conventional masculine and feminine design characteristics. In the history of fashion, the
                notion of
                androgynous fashion has been evolving since the 1920s, although it was irregular at times. In the
                postmodern
                western cultures, androgynous aesthetic in fashion is increasingly accept-ed, encouraging the
                multiplicity of
                gender expressions. With significant influencers of the generation identifying themselves as
                gender-neutral and
                speaking out on the topic, the concept of being gender fluid is catching a lot of attention recently in
                the
                international fashion industry. Androgynous fash-ion is an emergent trend, which reflects in fashion
                ramps with
                models showcasing silhouettes and design elements that breakdown gender stereotypes. With this in mind,
                the
                current research aims to study androgynous fashion from both conceptual and user-centric perspectives in
                the
                Indian context. Data were collected through primary and secondary sources. Relevant secondary data were
                gathered
                from various books, research papers, and fashion publications to set the conceptual context of the
                research.
                Additionally, to gather primary information about the Indian LGBTQ consumers’ perception of androgynous
                fashion,
                a questionnaire was circulated among young Indian fashion consumers using convenience and snowball
                sampling
                methods. The results and analysis of the study reveal the aspirations behind the gender-neutral design
                genre.
                This study also brings out the emotional needs of the Indian LGBTQ community members, who are the
                primary
                consumers of androgynous aesthetic.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Thermal comfort is the condition of the mind that the people report contentment with
                the
                surrounding environment. Four major environmental factors like; air temperature, radiant temperature
                (estimated
                by globe temperature), relative humidity, and air velocity influence thermal comfort. There are various
                kinds of
                literature available on thermal comfort in buildings, hospitals, industries, etc. in developed and
                developing
                countries. However, few pieces of literature are available on the kitchen environment like; rural homes,
                restaurants, and hotels, but related to the kitchen environment of the railway pantry car is almost
                nill.
                Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the average indoor thermal comfort parameters on the railway
                pantry
                car kitchen at a different cooking period. A total of 14 railway pantry cars included were this study in
                which
                six and eight pantry cars took in the summer and winter seasons respectively in 2018. In this research,
                with the
                help of a kestrel anemometer 4500, air temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity were measured.
                Although
                globe temperature measured was with a 6-inch black-globe thermometer. Descriptive analysis and
                Kruskal-Wallis
                tests performed were for the investigation using SPSS-16 software. A result of the descriptive analysis
                indicates that in both seasons, the value average thermal comfort parameters were found maximum at lunch
                and
                snack preparation time. The outcomes of statistical analysis revealed that there is no significant
                difference
                between all thermal comfort parameters during the summer season at the cooking period. A significant
                difference
                found between thermal comfort parameters during the cooking period in the winter season except for the
                parameters of relative humidity and air velocity. Furthermore, this result will help in estimating the
                comfort
                temperature of the pantry car kitchen at the modification of the workplace.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Co-design methodology takes user-centered approach a step ahead by including end-users
                directly
                in the design process. It ensures that their needs are well addressed by involving them as true experts
                of the
                experience. But when it comes to visually impaired (VI) children, it presents some unique challenges
                which
                mostly remain unaddressed with limited research in the domain. The paper addresses this gap by
                presenting a set
                of learnings which can assist the development of techniques for co-designing with VI children. We
                explore the
                co-design methodology for conducting ideation as part of a broader project centered around indoor
                navigation for
                VI children. We begin with a discussion of existing literature around co-design techniques for children
                and
                related work done for VI adults. Primary research was further done to understand the routine activities
                that VI
                children involve in and the challenges they face. Inspired by the insights gathered from this research,
                new
                co-design techniques were ideated. In all, 5 activities were chosen and conducted during the co-design
                session
                with 6 VI children. Findings and observations from this session are presented in the paper. Activities
                were
                found to be useful and thought provoking amongst children. It helped them in thinking and expressing new
                creative ideas which finally contributed in determining key directions for the solution. Finally, we
                present our
                learnings and discuss the best practices for conducting co-design sessions with VI children. These
                learnings can
                be further expanded and referred by fellow practitioners to build more innovative and accessible
                solutions for
                VI children.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In recent years, voice user interfaces have evolved substantially, enabling seamless
                and
                efficient human-machine interaction through spoken language. In spite of the increasing research, there
                is an
                absence of explicit evaluation methods for Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) for enabling their improvement.
                Presently, the evaluation criteria are primarily based on subjective metrics such as user reviews,
                ratings or
                likelihood of future use. While these met-rics have utility, they are often subjective to the users, and
                offer
                hurdles to research such as cost of recruitment, time and resources. Other alternatives are performance
                based
                such as response time and error rates, offering value to developers, but little insight into the design
                of these
                systems. There is a need for a usability-based evaluation method for VUI, analogous to the Heuristic
                Evaluation
                metrics proposed by Nielsen & Molich for screen-based interfaces. To address the same, our study
                presents a set
                of heuristics for usability evaluation of VUIs. Initially, existing literature in the domain of VUI was
                analysed
                to identify prevalent themes of usability issues. These themes were then categorised to define 11
                usability
                heuristics. The set of heuristics will enable designers to rapidly evaluate and investigate areas of
                improvement
                in VUIs. A between-subjects study with 12 HCI profession-als, involving usability evaluation of a VUI
                application, was conducted to test this hypothesis. The study reveals a statistically significant
                increase in
                the number and diversity of usability issues identified using the presented heuristics.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The term Product integrated photovoltaics (PIPV) is used for the products which
                includes
                integrated solar PV panels to provide electricity for the function of product. As PV panel is driving
                whole
                function of product, it becomes critical component which dictates overall design of it. In current
                scenario most
                of the easily available solar panels in market are rigid in nature with varying sizes and ratings. Also,
                there
                is an involvement of electronic system including charge controller circuit and batteries. It affects
                form
                exploration process while conceptualisation of product. Objective of this study is to understand the
                involved
                barriers in design process of PIPV products and to extract a design approach for them. To understand
                design
                process and evaluate one concept of PIPV product, it is prototyped and tested with users in actual
                scenario.
                Paper compiles the observations gathered from the journey of PIPV product from ideation phase to
                realisation
                phase and it concludes with framing of step by step approach for designing of new PIPV products.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The race of rapid urbanization has ended up developing numerous smart cities around
                the globe.
                But many of the cities developed in the last couple of decades have not been able to attract as many
                occupants
                as expected. A large amount of funds and resources are exhausted in this sector but the returns are not
                satisfactory. The infrastructure development is as per the vision and brainstorming of the experts and
                policymakers of the society. But the same is not accepted by the end-user of the recently developed
                smart
                cities. So, it is very important to understand the requirement of the end-user, to make these projects
                successful. The conventional methods of data collection for town planning like questionnaires, personal
                interviews, group discussions, public hearings, etc are having their limitations. The major issue with
                these
                data collection tools is they all are very time consuming and effort-intensive. The end-users lose their
                patience or interest and end up giving biased data. Which fails the entire purpose of end-user data
                collection.
                Hence, in this paper, we have designed a tool to collect user centred data from a large number of
                people, in a
                short duration of time. We have used card sorting techniques for making it interesting and easy to
                understand
                for the users. The data collected from this tool can be easily converted into the base blueprint of the
                city.
                The zoning of the city can be easily done and the same can be used as a framework for detailed planning
                as per
                the requirement of the users. So, this paper is on designing a user-centred town planning tool. This
                tool will
                ensure that the requirement of majority of the population is taken into consideration. It can be
                converted into
                a mobile app-based tool to have the vote of the entire population for designing their own town.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Sustainable Microgrid Design and Operation based on the Quality of Life in Rural
                India<br />Access to electricity can have beneficial impacts on the quality of life (QOL) in developing
                communities. Advancements in health, safety, and education can be realized through powering lights,
                water pumps,
                fans, and other devices. Still, electrical power is not widely available to rural Indian villages. The
                lack of
                availability is due to the remoteness of the villages and associated costs of the grid transmission
                infrastructure. Therefore, rural electrification often involves the use of solar microgrids. However,
                the
                implementation and sustainability of these systems are impeded in the rural setting due to a variety of
                challenges. The microgrid has a limited capacity that relies on resources that are intermittent in
                nature. Power
                consumption also increases for a period of time following electrification. The increase is due to
                changes in
                population and individual demand behaviors – both of which are difficult to predict. A problem occurs
                when the
                village outgrows the microgrid. Blackouts occur at an increasing rate which hinders rural development
                along with
                the QOL. This is the impetus for our work -- a mathematical framework for integrating QOL and power
                management
                into a smart microgrid system. The approach creates quantifiable relationships that exist between these
                domains
                in the context of sustainable rural electrification. The authors have proposed a set of eleven
                parameters to
                define the QOL. Each of these parameters can be evaluated through three components. These components are
                the
                condition, community importance, and energy dependence. The quantities established through this model
                make an
                inference to the design and operation requirements of the smart microgrid. Our work has considered the
                QOL model
                as part of the compromise decision support problem (cDSP). The cDSP is used in our framework to manage
                the
                limited supply of power among various electrical demands. In doing so, power is maintained to those
                needs which
                can sustain the QOL in the rural village. The authors’ work has demonstrated a technique in which the
                QOL may be
                quantified. At this point, we seek collaboration through the ICoRD community. Through this
                collaboration, we
                hope to improve the accuracy of the QOL model and the overall utility of our proposed framework.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The security system at the Indian railways mainly focuses on the X-ray scanning of
                baggage and
                metal detectors for ruling out the possibility of any life-threating object. Though so, the current
                management
                does not focus on the user-centric needs of safety and security as a service within the trains. The
                number of
                passengers traveling by Indian railways is ever-increasing and implanting a strong security system at
                all
                major/minor stations remains a challenge. Baggage theft in trains has remained unapprehended as a crime.
                As a
                consequence, people try to stay attentive by themselves which adds to a certain level of cognitive load
                for the
                users.<br />Currently, the Ministry of Railways has approved the installation of the \"Integrated
                Security
                System\" at important stations after detailed deliberations [1]. The system will comprise of Internet
                Protocol
                based Close Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance system with video analytics, Access control, Bomb
                Detection
                System and Personal and baggage screening system. The implementation of these systems is very slow and
                is not
                very efficient when it comes to personal baggage security inside trains. In the last 10 years over 1.71
                lakh
                theft cases were reported by railway passengers [2]<br />To investigate this problem from design
                perspective,
                field research was performed based on a survey of 107 participants and over 20 interviews were conducted
                as a
                part of Direct Observation and Analysis [3]. Multiple user case scenarios and a behaviour matrix were
                used to
                generate insights based on which a solution was proposed. This solution presents an electronic device,
                coupled
                with sensors and a microcontroller, which will be paired with a smartphone. The user can place this
                device
                inside the baggage for leveraging the security of their luggage. The device can measure instantaneous
                orientation of baggage using a 6-axis rotation sensor. On lifting the bag without informing its owner,
                the
                device shall detect and pass the information to the owner’s smartphone through wireless technology. The
                smartphone receives the data and raises an alarm. The device is insensitive to the rotation and
                vibration of the
                train movement. The design of the user interface in the smartphone is based on the minimalistic design
                principle
                to facilitate maximum convenience for users to operate it. A prototype was developed using an MPU6050
                sensor, an
                Arduino nano, and a Bluetooth module. The device was successfully tested in various trains and the
                feedback was
                appreciated by the primary users.<br />References<br />[1] Indian Railways Annual Report and Accounts

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Children of this era are considered as ‘digital natives’ as they are born and live in
                a world
                integrated with digital technologies. As a user of digital technology, they are expected to be aware of
                the
                fundamentals of computational thinking and logic to use it as a creative tool. Though there are many
                efforts to
                introduce computational thinking at the K-5 level globally, many children are still not exposed in India
                to the
                tools and techniques of the computational thinking and many of those who are exposed are apprehensive of
                learning how to code. The major reasons observed in India are 1) Lack of exposure to the computer in
                many areas,
                2) Lack of ludic value in the process of teaching computational thinking, 3) Cost of the toys and games
                available in the market are still beyond the capacity of many people, 4) Design of the toys and games
                without
                considering zone of proximal development. To address these issues a set of unplugged activities has been
                designed and developed using blended prototyping approach and the 5/10 method of game design as a
                framework.
                This paper illustrates the effort into a comparative analysis of the existing products, user study,
                state of the
                art review, design and testing to validate the design of low-cost unplugged activities for teaching
                computational thinking at the K-5 level.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the field of mobility, Harley Davidson is an iconic brand that has a loyal fan
                following.
                Hence, it is beneficial to observe the design values that the company has been propagating over time. To
                do
                this, the authors conducted a manual text analysis of 150 American Harley Davidson advertisements, which
                were
                evenly distributed across five decades beginning from 1920. The result of this analysis showed that
                irrespective
                of social, cultural, political, economic, or technological changes, ten design values were repeatedly
                observed
                in the advertisements namely aspirations, style, performance, convenience, affordability, comfort,
                durability,
                safety, conservation and security. The authors then further identified the ways in which each design
                value was
                achieved over time. In conclusion, the results of the study have been presented as a list to help

              <p><b>Visual Framework of Color analysis of shop signs in India</b></p>
              <p>Nanki Nath (National Institute of Design Ahmedabad)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Shop signs contribute to the visual representation of business identities through
                color, form
                and materials. Among these, in the context of India specifically, color becomes the foremost significant
                attribute for business image building in especially multi-cultural and competitive commercial street
                marketplaces. The researcher could observe and integrate certain qualities of colors displayed on shop
                signs
                through this methodological research approach of Bricolage [1]. These qualities are the four
                quadrants/factors
                of the illustrated framework in this paper. We have re-defined all the four quadrants by following an
                inductive
                rationale. This was done by selection of characteristic keywords for each quadrant from the established
                definitions, etymologies and findings by researchers and practitioners in the field of design. The
                classification theories using morphology, thematic basis, groupings and orderings as empirical data
                helped to
                formulate the framework of color analysis. The final picture of the framework illustrates all the four
                quadrants
                and their respective classifications along vertically and horizontally aligned domains. This form of the
                framework is flexible enough to provide multiple perspectives of quadrants as individual qualities as
                well as
                relative ones in a collective analytical group in order to analyze colors displayed on shop signs.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Cities around the world are becoming complex systems wherein every city possess unique
                identity
                manifested through its people and activities that occur in its urban spaces. The sense of urban space is
                an ever
                changing concept and to understand the fabric of urban spaces, knowledge of the concept of space and its
                interrelations is required. Reading a city in a time where change is the norm, with urban spaces gaining
                new
                meanings and functions with changes in cultural practices conveys the hybrid urgencies of metropolitan
                India. An
                analysis is thus, particularly relevant in India, as in the post-industrial scenario, cities in India
                have
                become some of the largest urban conglomerates with a dualist identity of static and kinetic pervading
                their
                urban landscape. The static city is the conventional physical entity of a city whereas, the kinetic city
                is
                perceived as a city in motion, temporary in nature and the emerging symbolic image of urban India.
                Understanding
                these multitude of identities in the backdrop of traditional events and festivals, as temporal
                transformations
                of urban spaces will thus highlight the dominant visual culture of Indian cities. This Temporal City
                enables a
                better understanding of the blurred lines of contemporary urbanism and the changing roles of social
                space in the
                urban fabric. This study focused on the ancient festival of Ambubachi in the historic Kamakhya Temple in
                Guwahati, India through visual ethnography, participant observations, open ended interviews, photography
                and
                document analysis. The central concern of this paper is to develop a critical stance on understanding
                the
                identities of cities through the study of urban spectacles such as festivals in a bid to illustrate the
                fluid
                and dynamic aspect of one’s identity that is being constantly redefined and reconstructed with time,
                space,
                activities and context. Through the analysis of this ancient festival of Ambubachi in the light of
                ‘identity’
                and ‘place attachment’ of the festivalgoers, the emerging notions of identity will be explored. The
                fieldwork
                sought to analyse two major aspects: The first was the generic, spatial characteristics of festival
                spaces and
                the second was the temporal, fleeting events that occur in their physical settings following the
                parameters of
                event-space relationship by Frenchman in a bid to understand how such eventful urban spaces manifest in
                the
                negotiation of one’s identity.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Digitization is disrupting our world and shaping the challenges that newly minted
                graduates will
                need to address in their professional careers. The solution to manage such disruptions is anchored in
                the
                principles of sustainability and values that are foundational to mitigating inequities by managing the
                tensions
                between the pulls of People, Planet and Profit. To succeed in the digitized world. we suggest that we
                provide
                the opportunity for our soon to be designers to develop five non-technical, career sustaining
                competencies:<br />1. To continue learning through reflection and the associated creation and
                articulation of
                knowledge.<br />2. To speculate and identify gaps that foster innovation.<br />3. To ask questions,
                actively
                listen, reflect, and identify gaps and opportunities worthy of further investigation.<br />4. To make
                decisions
                using incomplete information.<br />5. To think critically (deductive reasoning and inductive
                speculation) and
                identify a way forward.<br />Our intent in this talk is to promote reflection, dialog and action on
                modifying
                curricula to provide our soon to be designers the opportunity to internalize non-technical career

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>the role of intuition in decision making is widely recognized in many fields which saw
                a strong
                network of an intuition-based research community in this early turn of the century. However, it is
                poorly
                studied in the design field and notably little has been published on its role in design decision making
                especially on the early concept stages of the design process. Reviews of previous studies reveal that
                task
                uncertainty and creativity have a positive and significant impact on expert intuition. This makes it a
                more
                convincing case for studying the highly unstructured mode of problems that are typically found in
                design. The
                case study on intuition-driven design expertise was done as a triangulation of data source from the
                in-depth
                interview of eight expert and eight senior-level designers, followed by four sessions of focus group
                involving
                thirty-two participants made out of novice-level designers. Working around the common theme of \"Future
                workplace for Designers in the year 2050\", the result produced a rich comparative and descriptive
                attributions
                of intuition-driven decision making between experienced and novice designers at three different types of
                intuition. These finding later informs the three decision-making model for training design expertise
                based on
                (1) Affective Intuition which draws on emotion, heart and feelings; (2) Heuristic Intuition which draws
                on
                logic, theories, facts and hunches; (3) Holistic Intuition which draws on abs thinking, big ideas and

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Indian culture and ethos are the longest surviving one on the planet. There are
                in-numerous
                semiotic artifacts from Indian culture and traditional practices being passed since always, to this time
                and to
                the future. It is important to understand and decode them to understand the civilizational traits in
                this part
                of the world. One of the phe-nomenal existences is of Shiv lingam. There are unaccounted shiv lingams
                across
                In-dia and several other countries across the world. A Shivlinga represents the tangible form of Shiva
                and is
                being worshipped as such since time immemorial. It represents the infinite nature of lord Shiva. It
                represents
                the union of divine with nature and to-gether they are considered to originate ‘life’. Among all, the 12
                Jyotirlingas depict ra-diant symbols of God Shiva and are revered as the most auspicious ones. These are
                spread
                across India at 12 different shrines which are among the most visited holy places. These are considered
                to
                originate from the infinite light pillars. The paper tries to understand the consecrate FORM of these 12
                Jyotirlingas through an analysis of dimensions, shape, occurrence, etc. The dimensions and other
                features of
                Jyotirlingas were carefully observed. The knowledge about their formation was collected and put up for
                comparison against orders of size, shape, contour, color, texture, appearance, fitting, setting and
                occurrence.
                The result is drawn in form of a table and matched with the order of 12 Jyotirlingas as they come in
                Shiv Purana
                (Satarudra Samhita, Ch.42/2-4). It is interesting to note several similarities as well as some peculiar
                distinc-tions among these 12 Jyotirlingas. The place-based association was also intriguing. The size of
                these
                Jyotirlingas with respect to human scale also has relevance with their origin and nomenclature.
                Interesting
                insights about sign, semiotics and pragmat-ics have emerged with a careful observation of the 12
                Jyotirlingas

                  intervention</b></p>
              <p>Nithya Venkataraman (National Institute of Fashion Technology) and Kudrat Kashyap (National Institute
                of Fashion
                Technology)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Autism is a developmental disorder that leads to a characteristic pattern of
                perceiving,
                thinking and learning. It affects communication and social abilities of an individual. ASD (Autism
                Spectrum
                Disorder) is known as a “spectrum” because individuals can function at higher or lower ends of a
                continuum on an
                individual basis. The degree to which any one person is affected by the condition varies considerably
                from
                person to person. Hence Autism, due to its complex nature, has not been given much attention in design
                guidelines or in building codes.<br />Designing for learning and training spaces for a special community
                is
                often not just the onus, but also the soul of good design solutions. Spaces designed for individuals
                with autism
                should ideally make them sensorily comfortable. This can potentially help in the management of as many
                of the
                symptoms as could be manifestations of their sensory discomfort. Since the personal interpretation of a
                physical
                environment affects the meaning attached to it for the user, it becomes all the more important to design
                the
                built-environment for individuals with autism in order to maximise their efficiency. Individuals with
                ASD may
                experience some events as more, or less, intense than others around them; while other individuals with
                ASD may
                not seem to even notice some sensory information in certain settings. The physical structure of a space
                sets
                clear physical and visual boundaries to segment the environment so that each activity is clearly
                associated with
                a physical space. The colour, texture and acoustics of the physical space are some of the variables that
                affect
                the behaviour of an individual with ASD.<br />Research on adults with autism in India is scarce and
                hence, this
                study focused on the design of vocational training centres for adults with ASD. Individuals with ASD are
                trained
                in multiple vocational skills in order to obtain gainful employment. Vocational training for adults with
                autism
                currently includes craft based skills such as block printing, jewellery making, and weaving mufflers
                amongst
                others. This study employed a qualitative methodology, with an ethnographic approach. The tools used for
                data
                collection were observation, interviews and questionnaires. The study explored the possibility of
                applying the
                framework ASPECTSS™, to the space design and layout of the centres. Based on the preliminary
                observations, the
                study mainly focused on three areas under the framework, namely, Acoustics, Compartmentalisation and
                Escape
                spaces. Explorations were limited to one vocational training centre and within that centre, to the craft
                based
                section. Colour of the walls, textures of the floor and collapsible structures for compartmentalisation
                were
                some of the interventions that were suggested to the authorities in charge. Perceived improvements and
                changes
                are in line with the framework and have potential benefits not only for the trainees at the centre and
                their
                caregivers but also for the helping staff and the administration and will probably be the groundwork for
                welfare
                policies for individuals with ASD.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is an emerging area of interest to recognize

                Compared to other conventional manufacturing processes, Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers relatively a
                high
                degree of design freedom to create parts which could be used for redesigning parts for optimized
                material usage.
                In addition to material efficiency and geometric freedom, AM provides an opportunity for designs to have
                shape,
                material, hierarchical and functional complexity. Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) is always
                preferred to reduce the number of parts in the assembly to decrease the manufacturing and assembly
                difficulties.
                With the additional design freedom offered by AM process, Part Consolidation (PC) or Part Count
                Reduction (PCR)
                not only reduces the part count and simplify the product architecture but also provides a means for
                functional
                integration. The assembly level DfAM offers functional integration capabilities in addition to benefits
                such as
                cost, time and quality. By analyzing and redesigning the product at multiple levels, additional benefits
                can be
                realized. So, we introduce a two-level decision-making procedure at a product level and part level to
                adopt AM
                for developing products. At the product level, we developed a metric known as Product Adaptability
                Metric (PAM)
                to make a decision about PCR and reduce the total number of parts in the assembly to enable functional
                integration. In the part level, the individual part assessment is carried out with the help of Modified
                Complexity Factor (MCF) by using the geometry related parameters such as the volume of the part, the
                surface
                area of the part, and the height of the part, etc., to take final decision about the manufacturing
                process for
                the individual parts. We developed PAM by considering all the opportunistic design potentials of AM at a
                product
                level or system level for accurate decision making in the conceptual design stage. This developed
                two-level
                decision-making system can be further used to assess the product-process fit in the later stages of
                production.
                Two case studies have been carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Storyboard is one of the design process which includes creativity, concept and skill.
                Storyboard
                design is required in the form of drawings or illustrations for the content of animation production in
                the first
                stage of the production pipeline. It acts like a blueprint for the movies or series or animated clips
                and
                depicts the final design. In the production process, some Creative Directors, Animators have the
                creative skill
                and can visualize a concept but lacks the artistic skill of drawings to execute the storyboard. In this
                regard,
                the other team member or artist could not understand the concept of the Director. This papers focus on
                those
                people who lacks the sketching skill and provides a techniques that can be implemented to execute the
                concepts.
                For this, one survey was conducted on the Design based students studying in Central Institute of

              <p><b>Journey of product in Maker spaces - A Case Study</b></p>
              <p>Ar. Arun Soman (ImaginXP, Pune) and Ar. Neha Chourasia (SNAP associates)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>India being a country of variety, there is a variety of innovative products, available
                and made.
                Here is a journey of a small product and its development with the help of different maker spaces. The
                interest
                to use bamboo as a product designer has always pushed the imagination after experiencing the material.
                Bamboo is
                a very common Material and has been a major source of living for many tribes. In Past decades, mainly
                south
                Asian countries have brought bamboo as an industrial material. Just research & development in bamboo is
                not
                enough as the world is changing rapidly. An emerging trend of design collaboration is the key to our
                problems.
                As our environment and resources are changing, it puts us into a great threat. As the technology could
                not grow
                before handed. The growth of such technology depends on research & development of materials, product and
                user
                experiences. The small-scale industry could not afford such research & development, designers, and
                engineers do
                not have labs to innovate. Thus, a makers culture brought in some revolution were in, making is more
                focused
                then designing or innovation. Making something automatically inculcates innovation based on the
                requirement and
                comfort of the product. With this maker's culture, many makers were inspired but not everyone can avail
                space as
                per their need. In India, such space might be seen especially in the art institute, but these spaces are
                restricted to students only. Such a concept was taken forward and some maker spaces and design spaces
                were
                evolved. The paper will have a rigorous literature and case study of a product. This product which was
                incepted
                by a makers space and went through different maker spaces till its first prototype. The further study
                shall
                include the development requirement of a makers space and survey on some other maker spaces. Post
                research will
                be examined on the need of such makers space and its boon to the society</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Industry 4.0 i.e. the fourth industrial revolution drives the manufacturing industries
                through
                intelligentization and digitalization . Various industrial revolutions made a significant transformation
                in
                manufacturing industries. From Industry 1.0 to Industry 4.0, resulted in drastic industrial
                transformations like
                steam and water powered machines, electrical driven machines, automation and now digital automated
                manufacturing
                which makes production process more automatic, complicated and sustainable . Industry 4.0 defines a new
                stage of
                development and control on entire value chain of product life cycle which is focussed towards fulfilling
                customer requirements . The core purpose of Industry 4.0 is to fulfil the customer expectations
                associated with
                the areas like research and development, order management, recycling of products, agile delivery etc.
                The
                challenge associated with the Industry 4.0 era is the complexity of new technologies which needs to
                adopt by the
                manufacturing industries for its successful implementation. Industry 4.0 technologies includes, nine
                core
                technological pillars namely cyber physical systems (CPS), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Big
                data
                analytics, Additive manufacturing, Autonomous robots, Augmented reality, Simulation, Horizontal and
                vertical
                systems integration and Cloud Manufacturing. The customized products could be achieved with the help of
                Additive
                Manufacturing technology. With the context of growing digitalization, understanding the scope of design
                integration is necessary . The contribution of design methods in industry 4.0 facilitates innovation
                combining
                various technologies and addressing the issues associated with it. Design strategies enable the
                manufacturers to
                visualized the adoption process of Industry 4.0 and provide the solutions essential for its transition .
                Although there are various benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies, challenges associated with the
                implementation
                in real world cannot be ignored. Thus, there exist a need to look into some design methods or strategies
                leveraging to the fulfilments of Industry 4.0 requirements and its successful adoption. Design
                strategies like
                Design for six sigma (DFSS), TRIZ, QFD, Lean product development (LPD), Sustainable design, designing
                for
                agility and so on need to be studied from the context of Industry 4.0. The design strategies help to
                process and
                quality improvements, continuously improving margins and reducing waste which will smoothen the
                deployment of
                Industry 4.0 in organization. Accordingly, design strategies compatible with the Industry 4.0 need to be
                identified. In this context, this article aims to identify various design strategies and further
                analysing it by
                prioritizing using a suitable Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method for successful deployment of
                Industry
                4.0 in an automotive component manufacturing industry. The outcome from the study provides the priority
                order of
                design strategies to the decision makers or industry practitioners for the smooth adoption of Industry
                4.0.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The 20th century is evidence that is changing the way we live in India, dreaming for a
                better
                life, drives everyone to search for an urban space. The 100 smart city initiatives in India are further
                catalysts. The forming of cities can have a perspective, both inside out and outside in. A community's
                capabilities are equally important as the infrastructure system made up of products, services, and
                systems.
                Envisioning smart urban spaces in India requires a constant process of vision, a sensible execution, and
                a
                continuous discovery in our approach. The city-making process must learn the citizens to the places
                where they
                live and the action they do. New age cities must adopt social innovation to revisit their urban
                regeneration.
                Design-driven Social-innovation can create a new value system between actors and socio-material
                configuration.
                System Design thinking can be a tool for discovering the new age challenges and finding an answer with
                future
                relevance. Indian society and their socially diffused creativity can be an expression based on the local
                culture, a platform for action, well engaged over time to achieve a sustainable society. The rapid
                urbanization
                in India must be sensitive to recent phenomena and find a new urban development model that promotes
                happiness &
                collaboration. The 20th century can change the way we live yet gain smart India by sharing resources,
                quality of
                interpersonal relations, and the sharing of the skills that can foster mutual openness, conversation,
                and
                meaningful encounters. It can activate the local resources, knowledge, and skill of those involved in
                the

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Gartner predicted that by 2020, customers would manage 85% of their relationship with
                an
                enterprise, without human interactions. Here we are – more than halfway past 2020 and in times where
                this
                prediction is becoming a reality. To minimize human interactions with customers, the common
                (mis)perception and
                low-hanging fruit is the adoption of conversational technologies such as Chatbots and AI via a multitude
                of
                channels.<br />Brands are already cognizant that customer journeys have become dynamic, fluid, and
                unpredictable, as they consider usefulness, stay mindful and design for rapid changes in consumer
                desires.
                Customers tend to act on their needs of the moment - their expectations high and patience low. This

              <p>Hitesh Chaurasia (National Institute of Design Ahmedabad)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Voice conveys information as well as emotion in the film. The film sound production
                starts with
                voice recording and it informs the subsequent sound design. This paper examines the influence of sync
                sound
                recording technologies on the aesthetics of voice and sound design in the Hindi cinema since 2001. In
                the
                landscape of Indian cinema with the practice of dubbing, a unique aesthetics of voice evolved,
                privileging the
                human voice over all other sounds, imbuing it with ‘God-like’ acoustic properties. However, at the turn
                of the
                millennium, one observes a shift in the pattern of sound design with the re-emergence of sync sound
                recording
                technologies in the Hindi cinema. The present paper analyzes ten case studies of Hindi films through
                critical
                listening and comparative analysis of dubbed and sync sound films between 2001 to present. Observations
                from the
                analysis reveal that sync sound recording has caused a profound shift in sound design principles within
                mainstream Hindi cinema conforming more closely to global sound design aesthetics of realism.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This brief paper reports on research carried out as a part of a Visual Communication
                Project
                under the Graphic Design department at National Institute of Design, India, on the underlying subject of
                systemic design thinking towards easing the impact and aftermath of breast cancer in three primary
                stages of
                diagnosis, treatment and recovery.<br />While accepting that diseases are a natural occurrence is a
                rather
                debatable subject, life-threatening or not, they have often been dealt with in a rather defensive tone.
                One,
                among the many, that are unanimously feared and even tabooed is cancer. While we often focus on the
                clinical
                aspects of the disease, we overlook the fact that they have a life-altering influence on the life of the
                patient
                and his/her caregiver.<br />Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women in the world
                with 2
                million new cases in 2018 alone. (1) Overall, 1 in every 28 women is likely to develop Breast Cancer in
                her
                life. Let alone the daunting tone of the disease, the mind-numbing statistics and the helplessness that
                follows,
                it sets about a whirlwind of medical, physical, psychological, financial, social and sexual trauma for
                the
                person diagnosed as well as his/her supporters. The aim of the study is to assess and resolve the
                negative
                imprint of breast cancer on interpersonal relations, self-perception and social reaction by designing an
                effective caregiving solution and offering a healthy coping and holistic healing mechanism. It works
                towards
                inculcating positive thinking and safeguarding self-respect in the face of physical deformities and
                psychological stress. To eliminate the sense of powerlessness that takes over in times of an illness, It
                looks
                at offering accessible and inclusive strategies to mend and cherish relations between the caregiver and
                the
                patient during and post the journey. Personal experience in addition to undertaking primary and

                medical
                staff and other supporting relations, the approach delivered in this project was a ‘Cancer Positive’
                movement.<br />Cancer Positive is a collective and curative movement that makes use of data collection
                by
                adopting Internet of Things technologies to make caregiving more responsive and role-specific. Real-time
                data
                interpretation gives way to remote monitoring, telemedicine and behaviour modification, almost like
                having a
                personalized instruction manual and health coach in your pocket at all times. The database is assessed
                and
                allocated in cancer research facilities to formulate efficient modules for the training and development
                of
                healthcare professionals and caregivers. Unlike present resources, this system focuses on all-round
                recovery and
                not just survival and proposes modifications at several steps of the process right from how to address
                the
                disease itself. While technology and information have been transforming our day-to-day lifestyles,
                innovative
                usage of such mechanisms and devices can revolutionize healthcare to make it more personal, more
                effective and
                much more human.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>1.Introduction<br />Arunachal Pradesh is the largest state in the northeastern part of
                India.
                The topography of the region is very undulating. However, agro-climatic condition of Arunachal Pradesh
                is highly
                suitable for the cultivation of various types of horticulture fruits and spices like orange, apple,
                pineapple,
                banana, ginger, turmeric, chilly, etc. Ginger is the main cash crops of the region. Due to the lack of
                suitable
                ginger planting machine usually followed the manual method for ginger cultivation. Therefore, design and
                developed power operated mini ginger planter for hill agriculture which is light in weight, economical
                and
                suitable for the region. Chain and bucket metering mechanism attached with a chain is used for the
                planter. Two
                different types of cups were used for evaluation purposes such as triangular and circular. Performance
                of the
                ginger planter was evaluated at a forward speed of 0.75, 1.56 and 2.34 km/h. The performance test for
                planter
                was found satisfactorily.<br />2.Aim of research<br />The aim of the present research is to design and
                development a mini ginger planter suitable for the hilly region.<br />3.Methodology<br />The mini ginger
                planter
                was conceptualized based on brainstorming on feasible solutions. Important design features such as
                portable,
                compact size, safety in operation and attachment in the existing power source were considered during the
                creation of this model. Chain and bucked type of seed metering mechanism were used for the planter.
                Power to the
                metering shaft was provided from the ground wheel. The seed agitating device was provided in the bottom
                part of
                the hopper to prevent from compaction of seed inside the hopper due to vibration during
                operation.<br />3.Results and Discussion<br />The chain and bucket type metering mechanism was tested in
                the
                laboratory to check the picking or the lifting ability of the mechanism. The mini ginger planter has one
                row
                attached with a power tiller. The planter was tested under laboratory and field conditions. The seed
                spacing of
                the developed planter was tested on the sand bed. The results show that the depth of plantation and seed
                spacing
                was not dependent on the operating speed. Percentage of seed missing decreased with an increase in the
                speed of
                operation. The following performance was observed during laboratory test:<br />i)Average percentage cup
                filling
                was 111%<br />ii)The mean missing seed was 2.5%<br />iii)Physical damage of the seeds – 0%<br />iv)Mean
                seed
                spacing was 23 cm<br />Similarly, the field performance was also tested for the various parameters and
                found
                satisfactory.<br />4.Conclusion<br />In the Northeastern region of India scope for using heavy machinery
                are
                limitations because of the fragmented size of landholding and topographical constraints. The ginger
                planting
                work is still carried out in the region using the manual method. The developed single row ginger planter
                was
                found suitable for small and marginal farmers. Laboratory and field test results show that planter was
                working
                satisfactorily. The farmers accept the planter for ginger planting in the fields.</p>

              <p><b>Ways of Teaching - Simulating Real Life Scenarios into 21st century Interior Design Education</b>
              </p>
              <p>Amrita Ravimohan (ISDI School of Design & Innovation)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>As a practising interior designer/ architect turned design educator, the dichotomy
                that exists
                between the sanitised atmosphere of our campuses versus the messy reality of our ‘sites’ often strikes
                one as
                anomalous. It is imperative for students to better understand real-life scenarios, but the very nature
                of
                interior design sites means that it is difficult to recreate those conditions without having the actual
                experience. While all design schools christen the courses in which design projects are undertaken by
                their
                students as ‘studios’ (similar to what design practices call themselves); in their present form these do
                not
                allow for several crucial issues to be addressed.<br />It must be understood that certain design
                disciplines
                such as Product Design, Fashion Design, and Graphic Design find it easier to simulate these conditions
                as the
                nature of their creations is of a standalone variety, whereas the proposed design of an interior space
                is a
                conception that is rooted and hence dependent on many external factors. Secondly, if a design (or even a
                mock-up) is to be created in three-dimension for the purposes of demonstration, similar to the
                prototyping
                method used by product designers, it requires such a high investment of resources (time, labour and
                money) that
                it becomes unfeasible.<br />This paper aims to investigate the ways in which students, especially those
                in the
                latter half of their undergraduate design education journey, can learn in a studio environment that
                accurately
                reflects the potential which an ongoing site holds, along with its intrinsic constraints and challenges.
                These
                include:<br />- Exploring the ways in which New Age technology such as Augmented Reality (AR) and
                Virtual
                Reality (VR) can bring to life certain site environments that can behave like a building shell within
                which
                budding designers can realistically experiment with various iterations of their own designs.<br />-
                Examine how
                various design firms where the students work as interns, can better integrate the students’ contribution
                into
                the design process. Currently, the students work on ongoing ‘live’ projects but the timelines of the
                project and
                the internships often do not align, resulting in a gap in the learning curve of the student, at a
                crucial
                juncture of their design education.<br />- The enhanced role of faculty who have hands-on industry
                experience
                that can greatly augment the development of this process. As per feedback received from Interior Design
                students, they experience the chasm between ‘theory’ and ‘practice’ greatly, especially once they step
                out of
                the cocoon of the ‘institute studio’ and into the ‘office studio’.<br />The wind beneath the students’
                wings is
                the educator who encourages them to dream, experiment, make mistakes and be free of the commercial
                shackles that
                often dictate design decisions on sites. However, in order to have a complete education and become
                well-rounded
                designers, today’s design studios must better equip them with a holistic outlook of the profession,
                which
                includes the ability to recognise and acknowledge practical considerations. This, in the long run, will
                only
                improve the employability and placement prospects of the graduates of tomorrow.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Aluminium is a lightweight soft metal with moderate electrical conductivity. It is
                commonly used
                in aerospace, automotive industries as well as in day to day life. Several researchers and practitioners
                had
                worked to increase the strength of aluminium alloy by mixing some alloying elements such as Cu, Mg, Si
                with
                aluminium. The alloys are mainly prepared by stir casting and powder metallurgy techniques. Very few
                research
                works are carried out to increase the electrical conductivity of the aluminium alloy. In this paper
                powder
                metallurgy technique is applied to prepare aluminium metal matrix composite with 10%, 20% and 30% of
                copper
                weight percentage. Powder metallurgy technique is taken for proper dispersion of copper powder using
                ball
                milling process. SEM image shows the dispersion of copper with Al powder. Copper acted as binder to
                increase
                hardness when tested by Rockwell hardness tester. Densities of all three composites are measured. The
                significant amount of electrical conductivity is increased by increasing copper percentage. Lowest
                electrical
                resistivity is achieved for Al-30% Cu composite and highest for Al-10% Cu composite.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This paper employs a metaphoric reading of a political event of a protest from the
                per-spective
                of design and space. It does this by treating the event as a performance, thus applying the notion of
                staging to
                the real life event. Protest stagings involve expressive spatiality and visualization. Visual images
                from the
                event are examined closely to reveal various vectors at work which upset the conventional opposition
                between
                performance and life; design and emergence. The method employs aspects of staging like actors, costumes,
                props,
                devices, scripts, and dialogues to highlight the dramatic appropriation of everyday space for the sake
                of the
                event. The event creates spaces that do not otherwise exist outside the performance of democratic
                protest and
                pitches emergence against design and tactics against strategy. The widespread and intense protests that
                took
                place in India over the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019-2020 period serve as the event under study.

                Studies
                (UPES), Dehradun-248007, Uttarakhand, India.)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Introduction & background<br />Under privileged people don’t get enough donations in
                the form of
                cash, food or items, as people are not much aware about the problems under- privileged are facing. As
                they
                belong to below poverty line statistically they are more likely to become involved in crime. According
                to a
                report published by Govt. of India, about 12.4% of Indians are extremely poor and are below poverty
                line.
                Requirement of donation for them as per the perception of people and influence from others are the
                variable that
                influences people to donate online. Further people seek for the impact they have made on organization
                after the
                donation.<br />Aim & objectives<br />Aim is to connect the donor and non-profit organization through a
                web
                application and expected that the application can bring benefits to both parties and make the donation
                activity
                easy to be done. To achieve this goal, following objectives were considered :<br />1. To support orphans
                of
                different orphanages by the people who wish to contribute the children and adopting children through
                online<br />2. To Donate the money, food, clothes, other items, voluntary the charity events, pre-owned
                things
                to orphanages, under privileged schools and old age homes.<br />3. To provide them emotional support, so
                that
                people come to meet them and spend some time with them to make them feel happy and
                wanted.<br />Methodology<br />By standardized questionnaire got to know donar’s demographic information,
                items
                user would more likely to donate , motivation or reason behind donation , donation frequency of user.
                Observational study and interviews of people were conducted in different organization with teacher’s at
                underprivileged schools, student, care taker of orphanage , children , care of old-age home , old people
                to know
                about the problem they are facing and their daily routine and then performed simple random sampling to
                prioritize the features. Therefore the preferred feature is integrated so that user can take assistance
                from
                home and donate things. To ease the process of donation we use message, email, push notification feature
                in the
                application that can help the non-profit organization, feature was built so that the donor can provide
                more
                detail on the donation and ask questions to the non-profit organizations.<br />Results &
                discussion<br />Result
                of the present study suggests that user like to donate clothes and food items more often than by
                donating cash.
                This research was exploratory, investigating the factors that influence people's willingness donate
                online,
                including the socio‐demographic characteristics of donors. Results show that gender, perception of the
                organization, and influence from others are variables that influence the likelihood of donating
                online.<br />Conclusion<br />Created web application is accepted by donors for providing various
                supports to
                underprivileged people. Hence, this web portal could be implemented by government or NGOs in near future
                to
                support underprivileged people.</p>

              <p><b>What can designers learn from failed solution in BOP contexts?</b></p>
              <p>Pankaj Upadhyay (Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati) and Ravi Mokashi Punekar (Indian Institute of
                Technology Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The topic of design and development of solutions for the base of the pyramid (BOP) and
                similar
                contexts has garnered significant attention in recent litera-ture. This topic is multidisciplinary with
                dimensions of Business, product de-sign, supply chain, sustainability, and social development. Many
                contribu-tions in each of these dimensions use a case study based approach for devel-oping theories,
                guidelines,
                and heuristics. Arguably, despite explicit mention, most selected cases in these studies are included in
                the
                analysis because they are successful. Unfortunately, this may create an inadvertent sampling bias in the
                body of
                knowledge generated. Furthermore, this may be unavoidable since failed case examples, barring a few, are
                never
                reported in academic or non-academic literature. In this paper, we attempt to partially fill this lacuna
                by
                collecting and analysing six case examples that are considered and reported as failed. To do this,
                first, we
                conduct a systematic search in academic and non-academic sources to find examples of unsuccessful
                solutions for
                margin-al context. Selected cases from the list are analysed to understand why they are reported as
                failures. We
                study these cases based on a framework derived from a review of recent relevant literature.
                Specifically, we
                highlight the rec-ommended guidelines which we found in our research, which the case exam-ples followed
                or did
                not follow. Given the results, we propose some changes to the design process when designing solutions
                for the
                base of the pyramid and similar marginal context. Additionally, we discuss the implication of the study
                for the
                general mindset, which the designer must inculcate to design for the BOP effectively. The paper
                concludes with a
                discussion on the scope for future research and limitations of the presented work.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The notion of well being has been becoming a faraway reality. With evolution, the
                environment
                around us has also changed. The need to survive and the inborn nature to compete has eventually led us,
                humans,
                to achieve unattainable things. Which in turn, has made us susceptible to many of the conditions like
                depression
                and anxiety.<br />This project done on mental health works towards creating a space which will
                indirectly
                control our senses to enhance our moods emphatically. This will lead to the so-called empowerment of our
                mental
                health. Even though people are aware of what they should have been doing in order to achieve the state
                of a
                healthy mind. They are still incapable of doing so. Time restrictions and financial limitations are one
                of the
                important factors contributing to them largely.<br />This project has been done as a part of Systems
                design
                project through the case study of the students living in Kota, Rajasthan. One of the categories among
                the
                research groups which includes: Age, Occupation and Family type. The design intervention came through
                the
                research will eventually aid in achieving those little yet significant tasks/experiences which makes our
                well
                being.<br />Space which surrounds us from the moment we wake up till we sleep can affect our mental
                health
                immensely. The ambience, which consists of lights, colours, sound textures and aroma, indirectly signals
                our
                brain to be at a certain state of mind. The creation of a manipulative yet sympathetic environment can
                control
                the space which will include furniture and supportive systems. The design intervention to secretly and

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>1. Introduction and background<br />Now-a-days many universities have a student portal
                which
                students are generally used to check their academic records like attendance, results, fees payment
                status etc.
                SAP student portal operates on enterprise resource planning system which integrates various processes
                into one
                single system. In case of student portal, it stores personal information of student and all his academic
                records
                in one database. At present SAP student portal has been implemented by many universities. However, many
                Indian
                students are not often facing problems while using such student portal. This might cause bad experience
                to
                students while using the portal.<br />2. Aim and objectives<br />This research aims to identify causes
                of bad
                experiences for the SAP student portal in ‘X’ University and resolve experience related problems using
                interface
                design intervention. Therefore, there is a chance to make the student SAP portal more user
                friendly.<br />3.
                Methodology<br />Our target audience are all Indian students of bachelors and masters programme of X
                university,
                having age group of 15-30, in which 74% are male and 26% are female. These students are from family
                background
                where annual family income varies from 8 - 20 lakhs rupees per annum. User interviews and survey were
                conducted
                to know student experience related to the SAP portal. For data collection, we used random sampling
                technique.<br />In user research we collected data on how frequency of use of the SAP portal, purpose of
                use of
                SAP portal, problems while using the portal, time taken in completing the task and willingness of using
                the
                portal if it improves.<br />Based on the user feedbacks, a new SAP portal was designed to resolve the
                issues
                faced by students in case of existing SAP portal for students. Then the usability of new SAP portal was
                compared
                with the existing SAP portal on the basis of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and willingness
                to
                use.<br />4. Results and Discussions<br />It was observed that most of the participants are using SAP
                portal
                for- 1) checking attendance (65%), 2) checking of exam schedule and other exam related notices (63%), 3)
                checking personal information and documents (60%), 4) checking timetable (55%), 5) giving faculty
                feedback
                (50%), 6) checking fees payment related information (50%).<br />Many students are facing problems
                related to- 1)
                organisation and management of data (65%), 2) delayed access to information (63%), and 3)
                Non-interactive GUI
                (60%).<br />When students are provided with new SAP portal solutions, it was observed that they
                perceived new
                SAP portal as more useful, easy to use and thereby students are willing to use the new SAP portal than
                the
                existing SAP portal.<br />5. Conclusion<br />It is envisaged that the newly designed SAP portal might be
                helpful
                for university students for timely and easily access to important information and fees payment.</p>

                Dehrdun-248007, India.)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND<br />Students often are aware of the need to network
                professionally,
                but don’t always know how to start. Profile building, tracking invitations, profile views are other
                barriers.
                Currently, job or internship search for freshers (students) is difficult in LinkedIn as there is no
                specific
                search option for the same. Moreover, tracking of application and interview status are not available in
                LinkedIn. Therefore, students might not able to track their job or internship status
                easily.<br />OBJECTIVES<br />The objectives of this study were to make LinkedIn into a productive
                application
                for college going students to accelerate their job or internship hunting process within their own
                professional
                circle and provide an effective interface design solution to overcome problems related to job or
                internship
                search in current LinkedIn.<br />METHODOLOGY<br />Both Qualitative (interview) and Quantitative (user
                survey)
                approach was used to identify the hindrances and motives of college students with respect to LinkedIn
                usage for
                job or internship search. User journey map and empathy mapping were done based on responses collected
                through
                user interview. After that user surveys were conducted with 15 structured questions and data was
                collected
                through simple random sampling. Target Group were college students; ages ranging from 18-28 years old of
                which
                40% were females and 60% were males. Undergraduate and postgraduate students from fields like Design,
                Architecture, Computer Science were chosen for the survey. Then an extended LinkedIn interface was
                designed with
                additional features such as profile building template, profile statistics, and job or internship filters
                etc.
                based on problems stated by users. The effectiveness of the design was tested through usability testing
                and
                compared with the existing LinkedIn on the basis of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and
                willingness
                to use.<br />RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<br />From interview responses and user survey, it was witnessed that
                students faced difficulty in keeping track of company HR’s and their emails and contact details, require
                filters
                during Job search etc. The redesigned interface helps cutdown the time taken for job/internship search.
                Tasks
                are easily performed regarding profile hunt, contacting senior professionals and handling multiple data
                due to
                Profile Statistics. As per the User Testing conducted on 30 individuals, the Perceived Ease of Use and
                Perceived
                Usefulness is higher for the redesigned interface as compared to the existing application. Customer
                Acceptance
                model indicates that the satisfaction bar is higher within the
                individuals.<br />CONCLUSION<br />LinkedIn
                Students aids college graduates to search for jobs or internships that could be a best fit. Therefore, a
                redesign of LinkedIn (Students) would be beneficial for students.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The narrative of traditional Indian Craft and traditional Textile is woven tightly
                with
                sub-continent’s culture. These indigenous crafts and traditional textiles in India are clustered in
                small weaver
                communities or tucked away in rural artisan pockets far from the urban settlements. These craft cluster
                communities make artisanal handmade products for unchanged rural, massy urban and niche luxury
                markets.<br />Spradley (1979) defines, Ethnography as the work of describing a culture from the native
                point of
                view. Ethnography in that sense, in this study, bridges the rural and urban divide to understand
                indigenous art,
                craft and the people in them.<br />This paper describes ethnographic research methods that are used as a
                way of
                studying different indigenous Indian art and craft forms, and the craft communities who make these
                artisanal
                products. Enlarges how design students co-create and innovate design solutions in the textile and craft
                sector.
                And within these inter-cultural exchanges and interactions, students learn the life lessons of being
                culturally
                sensitive.<br />Through an extensive review of existing literature, decade long ethnographic studies in
                various
                craft-clusters through out India (conducted in past by the author), and semi-structured interviews with
                the
                students, the study aims to answer the core questions of the research with an objective of perhaps

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The renewable energy industry is seeing exponential growth in India. Among the many
                clean energy
                sources, floating solar PV (FPV) projects are being preferred because of its many advantages. The
                installation
                and maintenance of FPV panels are generally been executed by an informal and inexperienced/semi-skilled
                work-force who are exposed to the emerging challenges, which may lead to compro-mising of Occupational
                Safety &
                Health (OSH) aspects. To explore the ground scenario, field surveys were carried out to study the OSH
                scenario
                which re-vealed that the workers are highly exposed to different occupational hazards dur-ing
                installation and
                maintenance of FPV panels due to heavy load handling, awkward postures, inappropriate tools, lack of
                safety
                measures against the harsh working environment (hot Sun, electrocution, drowning, etc.), lack of

                better occupational health of the workers and felt the need for protecting the workers from the hazards
                especially through design inter-ventions. This study is a maiden effort in understanding the OSH aspects
                in the

              <p>Deepak Ranjan Padhi (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay) and Sugandha Katoch (Indian Institute of
                Technology

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In the past few years, virtual reality (“VR”) has been explored as a potential medium
                that
                provides immersive experiences. VR features are being evolved for active engagement. However, there is a
                lot of
                scope in researching how the VR experience varies across demographics. For example, how does an emergent
                user
                (education below 10th standard, hardly exposed to Information and Communication Technologies, or “ICTs”)
                experience VR in comparison to a tech-savvy user (graduate, highly exposed to ICTs)? We performed
                mixed-method
                research with two experiments using mobile VR headsets. Experiment-1 was conducted to study the
                \"immersion\"
                effect by asking the participants to watch a virtual “roller coaster” ride video. Experiment-2 was
                conducted to
                gauge the effect of \"embodiedness\" and the “embodied interaction” with the medium. Here, the
                participants were
                asked to play the “Moon Bird” VR game, while moving their hands like a bird's wings. Qualitative and
                quantitative results were compared across the two user groups. Neither had experienced VR before. We
                found that
                emergent users got engaged better than tech-savvy users when there is only a perception of the virtual
                environment (experiment-1). Hand movements acted as a cognitive load for emergent users (experiment-2)
                in the
                beginning, but eventually, most expressed themselves as the game character. On the other hand,
                tech-savvy users
                possessed a strong distinction between the virtual and real environment but were found to be more
                engaged when
                they could interact with the virtual environment, rather than just perceive it. We discuss the findings
                and
                provide recommendations for future studies.</p>

                /designing.
                As designers thought processes are converted into sketches, one has to have good knowledge on the basic

                of design. Function, Aesthetics, Ergonomics, and Usability constitutes the broad elements of design.
                Each design
                will have sub parameters, which designers need to prioritize and give more emphasis to those elements in
                particular. Linkographs will help in identifying the spaces, where a product can be value added to make

                innovative. For all the identified design elements along with sub parameters, linkographs have been
                plotted by
                taking a design case study. This approach shall emphasize on value parameters while designing the
                product and
                shall serve as a template for reference. Value addition can be evaluated in terms of design elements via
                the
                developed linkographs.</p>

              <p><b>Recreating the past methodology to design a better society for the future</b></p>
              <p>Natasha Turkar (National Institute of Fashion Technology, Mumbai)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>With the omnipresence of design, our future is a visualization of further convergence
                of the
                world with technology as its nucleus. Professionals across all disciplines have been envisioning a
                future
                dependent on technology, where Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and Big data form a
                multifaceted design universe. However, this paper challenges the notion of the future design methodology
                relying
                heavily on technological advancements and proposes the question of how design can borrow from the past
                and
                harness the power of reflective nostalgia to build a better society in the future. The research
                discusses the
                plausibility of design creativity and synthesis coming a full circle - being driven by societal
                necessity in the
                past, customized user-centric exclusivity in the present to its reliance on empathy, reassurance, and
                security
                on a social level, in the future. The research methodology and study conducted has been summarized to
                highlight
                how any product we have designed, became a part of an environment larger than us, taking up an
                intangible
                behavioral form, which came back to redesign us. Thus, reflecting on this past methodology and taking
                the
                traditional wisdom forward is paramount. The directions for further research have also been discussed.

              <p>Isha Patel (ISDI Mumbai). Designing Brand-Led Cultures in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME’s)
              </p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Small and medium-sized enterprises are engines of employment and innova-tion,
                contributing to
                95% of businesses in most countries. The world of brand-ing is dominated by large businesses, but there
                exists a
                lack of SME perspec-tive on the subject (Krake 2005); (Berthon, Ewing and Napoli 2008); (Wong &
                Merrilees,
                2005). This study investigates into challenges of SMEs that limit their understanding and use of
                brand-led
                strategies and states how SMEs can use their own brand to enhance longevity and sustenance for their
                companies.
                It will therefore benefit SMEs across the globe, irrespective of what sector they belong to. As
                observed, SMEs
                have successfully challenged large corporations by developing market-focused brands in the last decade.
                The UK
                Design Council has also noted that SMEs adopting a design-led approach are more successful than those
                who do
                not. It therefore becomes essential to identify the challenges and overcome them through further
                research. This
                research follows a qualitative approach and expresses a metaphorical relation between humans and SME
                brands.
                Brands are personified and their life cycle is illustrated. SME struggles are compared to midlife crisis
                in the
                human life cycle. It can be said that SMEs are in the same ambiguous state of mind as humans facing the
                ad-vent
                of midlife crisis. The recommendations made in this study will equip SME leaders to understand their
                organization from a grassroots level and bene-fit through development of a brand-led culture within
                their
                organization, mak-ing them competitive through strategic use of their own brand. This study is attending
                to
                identify a much larger gap in the industry, raising a conversation that has potential for further
                research.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Across generations game has always been a pleasurable part of human life. People have
                spent
                plenty of time at once playing various games in different environments from playground to digital
                console and
                now to the smartphone apps. The recent trend of gamification technique engages learners from various
                domains on
                their concern area very efficiently. This technique focuses on taking game play elements and game
                mechanics in a
                non-gaming settings or context, making it interesting and more engaging for the learner. Digital games
                when
                designed to share indigenous viewpoint can prompt insightful discussions that can go far beyond a game
                play
                session.<br />This paper is an attempt to put forward a conceptual framework of a player-centered-game
                design,
                exploring the indigenousness of Naga tribe of Northeast India. Most of the tribes of Northeast India do
                not
                possess a written script of their own but they survived through tales of their legends, myths, customs
                and
                beliefs by oral tradition from one generation to another. This oral tradition also existed as part of
                Naga
                culture where their cultural values and beliefs were transmitted by the elder members to their younger
                generation in their ancient traditional dormitory called “Morung”.<br />With the advent of globalization
                and
                modernization, this traditional youth centric dormitory system was replaced with modern schools and
                colleges.
                Though it was a healthy replacement but it led to the shunning of their traditional dormitory system
                constricting their cultural value sharing possibilities between generations. The ongoing loss of
                customs,
                traditions and other aspects of their culture has led to a situation of high risk of losing their
                cultural
                values forever.<br />This case study is a novel approach of spreading awareness among the new generation
                of Naga
                tribe towards the necessity of acknowledgement, restoration, revival and preservation of their age old
                culture
                and beliefs. The proposed conceptual game tries to create an effective environment through game-based
                learning
                where young generation can practice the real life situations and challenges in the form of role-play as
                “The
                Saviour”, making choices to safeguard and restore the lost customs and traditions in a fictional
                settings. The
                game’s effective story-line based on the indigenous Naga tribe will try to motivate the core drive of
                new
                generations to make them realize the authenticity, need of empowerment, significance and ownership of
                their
                customs and traditions. To evaluate the acceptance and authenticity of the content of the conceptual
                game, a
                survey was carried out within a small group of Naga people. The positive response and acceptance and
                their
                comfort towards the virtual world have created the possibility to proceed a step further towards the
                development
                of the conceptual game.<br />Further this game-based learning experiment also tries to explore the scope
                of
                archiving the cultural heritage of Naga tribes through intervention of digital technology with more
                advanced
                approaches.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>‘Our Machines are disturbingly lively whilst we ourselves frighteningly
                inert’<br />Donna
                Haraway (1991)<br />This paper is part of a body of work which includes exhibitions, events and a
                symposium. The
                aim of the project is to look at the relationship between technology and the pioneering work of artists
                and
                designers. Our Machines includes a wide range of cross-discipline and inter-generational works that
                reflect on
                the role art and design has on humanising technology as much as it questions the notion of limit-less
                progress
                or that references to the natural world are fast disappearing. The artists and designers are far from
                ‘inert’ in
                their exploration and sometimes exploitation of new technology. Most of the works included are
                time-based media,
                which by definition are illusionary and non-existent, yet instrumental in asking the viewer to question
                a world
                where multiple views show reality in a state of flux. For this paper the focus will be on specific
                examples of
                work that in their installation offer experiential, interactive, immersive and generative interactions.
                Our
                relationship with machines has evolved and in the age of the anthropocene how much does our corporeal
                relationship with technology negate our desire to be immersed in the natural world?<br />Looking at
                interactivity within space, place and spirituality and the relation these have to new technology
                historically,
                which we can image a future. The arts are often at the forefront of new experiential epochs, testing and
                challenging our human relationship to new technologies: slapstick within the early cinematic experience
                was one
                of heightened audience engagement; early design theorists strove towards a utopian future where
                technology would
                create social change for the better; analogue processes although superseded by digital technology are
                systematically re-appropriated; the body dissolves within in a virtual platform where freedom from the
                real can
                proliferate; early video tape technology offered a voice to those who were formerly unable to gain
                access to
                film processes; the introduction of the Apple Mac computer gave designers new freedoms to explore
                post-modern
                expressive and radical messages; AI and generative processes mean that we, as audience can affect the
                magic of
                creation with our touch, or look on as the work creates itself.<br />History tells us much about the
                future of
                technology affirming many of the systems of change we are dealing with now and shall do even more so in
                the
                future. The romanticism of nature was replaced by the magic of technology in the industrial age. These
                moments
                in history made for spiritual shifts as much as they heralded a practical force for change. In an era
                where
                machine learning and generative processes are becoming the normative practices of interactive design,
                this
                evolution becomes as much of a grand utopian gesture as it does a passive extension of the human
                experience;
                perhaps reinforcing our creative powers by amputating our natural ones. Artists and designers continue
                to
                explore new digital territories and whilst doing so even are more aware of the need to reinvigorate a
                ‘cyborg
                manifesto’ for the future.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Eye orbital floor fracture is a common occurrence due to traumatic eye injuries during
                contact
                sports, motor vehicle accidents or impact by blunt objects. Another cause is sudden increase in
                intra-orbital
                pressure. The consequences include orbital volume ex-pansion, double vision or loss of vision in severe
                cases.
                Owing to the complex orbital anatomy, such fractures are very difficult to manage. In case of large
                orbital
                floor frac-ture, surgical repair or reconstruction is carried out using implants to restore the orbit
                and its
                volume. Standard titanium implants used for this purpose are flat in shape and require manual bending.
                The
                manual process is not precise, and causes non-conformity of the implant surface with orbital floor and
                lifting
                of the implant at posterior end, giv-ing unsatisfactory outcomes.<br />This research aims at design and
                fabrication of orbital implants that are customized to the patient’s anatomy. This implies matching the
                prominent ‘S-shape’ of the orbital floor, starting from the rim and extending up to inferior orbital
                fissure.
                The design starts with the generation of 3D anatomical model from DICOM (Digital Imaging and
                Com-munications in
                Medicine) files obtained from the CT (Computed Tomography) scan of the patient. The generated 3D model
                is then
                used to design a customized orbital implant using medical CAD software, ensuring that the degree of
                freedom of
                the eye is main-tained. Considering the free-form shape of the designed implant, it is additively
                manu-factured
                on DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) system using Titanium- (6%) Alumini-um- (4%) Vanadium ELI (extra
                low
                interstitial) powder. After post-processing and steri-lization of the fabricated implant, it was
                surgically
                implanted in the patient. The post-operative CT images revealed that customized implant was conformed to
                the
                S-shaped orbital floor, thereby providing the required stability to the implant. The orbital volume was
                also
                restored to the normal value, thus correctly aligning the affected eye with the normal eye.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>According to S. Endle, the Bodos are one the largest ethnic communities among the
                Indo-Mongoloid
                origin of Tibet o Burmese language family and the largest single speaking ethnic community in North-east
                India.<br />The community has significant traditions of visual culture, particularly of wood carving,
                hand loom
                and textile, craft works, horticulture and folklore. The community also had wide knowledge in weaving
                garments
                from grasses, fibers and cotton, what they grew from silk, both wild and domesticated. It is significant
                that
                the silk of sericulture was introduced in North Eastern India, many centuries before the arrival of
                Vedic Aryans
                by the ancestors of Bodos (S. Endle,1997).<br />Spinning of Endi yarn and weaving is household industry
                and
                every woman of the community is skillful enough to express in the finer art of hand loom craftsmanship.
                However,
                the new generation of the Bodo community rarely follows the ancient cultural practices due to lack of
                preservation, documentation and research of about the Art and Artifacts of this
                community.<br />“Considerable
                amount of changes has taken place in the dress outfits not only the male section but the female section
                as well.
                Similarly, the art of dying yarn and cloths which was a community secret of the tribe is gradually
                fading out”
                (“Tribe of Assam Part- I” by B.N.Bordoloi, G.C.Sharman and M.C. Saikia).<br />This paper evolves from
                the
                research gap through a critical review of the limited literature available in the field of Bodo hand
                loom and

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The process of product design and development (PDD) consists of various sequential
                stages. Each
                stage requires a complex evaluation and the right decision to attain a successful product.
                Decision-making in
                these product design stages often is involved with multiple criteria and it is important to use multiple
                criteria decision making (MCDM) to assist design practitioners for more appropriate decisions. Nowadays,
                various
                MCDM methods are available and applied in various areas. The objective of this paper is to identify the
                types of
                decision-making problems that may creep during different design stages and possible MCDM methods that
                might be
                applicable to solve them. This paper presents comparative analysis and gives information about some of
                the most
                popular MCDM methods with the design decision applications as per the available literature. This
                knowledge can
                help enterprises make better decisions in a particular design stage to ensure the success of their PDD.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The study aims to understand the factors that influence perceptions of elderly persons
                about
                flooring slipperiness and to observe if there is a difference between the perceived slip-resistance
                (PSR) and
                the measured slip-resistance (MSR) of flooring in residential environments of elderly
                peo-ple.<br />Methods: 262
                flooring samples in residences of 48 elderly persons living independently in communities participated in
                the
                study. ASM 925 DCOF slip meter was used to measure MSR. PSR was assessed with a semi-structured
                questionnaire.
                Mann Whitney U test was performed for testing difference between MSR and PSR.<br />Conclusions: The
                study
                concluded that the influencing factors for MSR and PSR were not similar. Measured slip resistance was
                concerned
                with factors related to the environment. PSR in addition to the environmental factors, was found to be
                influenced by individual’s sensory and psychological factors which were rarely considered by MSR
                assessments.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Synonymous with imagination and reasoning, creative and critical thinking used
                together
                increases the possibility of desirable outcomes in situations requiring problem-solving, a prime
                function of
                design. Teaching creativity and criticality appears to be an inevitable task in design education.
                However, it is
                often assumed that learners will gain these thinking skills tacitly as a by-product of certain course
                content
                delivery that focuses on conceptual or factual knowledge, and technical skill development, for the
                creative
                disciplines. This paper examines the effectiveness of “Think Lab”, a domain-specific, experimental
                learning
                module, that aims to develop the creative and critical thinking potential of Foundation (first) year
                undergraduate students of design. Drawing from the work of creativity experts Edward De Bono and Michael
                Michalko, amongst a few others, Think Lab equips students with formal tools, techniques and strategies
                for
                creative and critical thinking. It takes a constructivist approach to learning-teaching, strategically
                combining
                the tenets of experiential learning theory and collaborative learning. Primary data has been collected
                from
                three batches of students who attended Think Lab, to investigate the appropriateness of the content
                (what is
                taught) as well as the effectiveness of the learning-teaching methodology (how it is taught), in context
                of

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Rapid modernization taking place in the 21st century especially in developing
                countries like
                India having multiple religious faiths has seen major changes in social, economic and environmental
                aspects.
                With these rapid changes, a major concern and challenge is to retain identity of socio-cultural
                institutions
                found in India. Design details of architecture and assets used in these institutions with
                religious/social
                significance are hence, an important feature, which reveals the indigenous identity of these
                institutions. This
                paper, focuses on understanding and documentation of the identity of “Naamghar”, a social-cultural
                institution
                associated with Vaishnavism found in Assam so that the essence of it as identity of Vaishnavism can be
                institutionalized to facilitate translating it for Naamghar to be established in future. It focuses on
                three
                major aspects of indigenous identity of Naamghar: Visual design details of the exterior and interior of
                a
                Naamghar, Relation of design details with Vaishnava faith, and Spatial and temporal evolution of
                Naamghar. This
                paper unfolds the evidence based research and results towards structured design approach through form
                study with
                typicality analysis in Naamghar of urbanizing Assam and its fragmented areas in different parts. This
                paper
                discusses and shows systematic way and how a unique identity has been transformed over the period of

              <p>Richa Sharma (National Institute of Fashion Technology, Bengaluru) and Nilanjana Bairagi (National
                Institute of
                Fashion Technology, Bengaluru)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The abundance of light in the urban nightscapes is responsible for beyond visual
                effects on
                humans as it may affect the circadian cycle thus affecting the anxiety and sleep related disorders.
                Photoluminescent pigments are rare earth metals that absorb light and emit it slowly as a pale
                blue/bluish green
                light over 6-8 hours after initial excitation from external light source. These pigments can be
                incorporated in
                textiles in many ways such as filaments, coatings, tapes, vinyl stickers or printing with suitable
                binders. But
                there is limited literature to guide textile and fashion designers on how these pigments may be used to
                create
                novel illuminated patterns of luminescence as prints for home fashion. Moreover, systematic studies on
                the
                possible design effects that can be achieved on fabrics while printing with photoluminescent prints has
                not been
                reported in literature. Therefore this research aims to systematically study the properties of
                photoluminescent
                pigments and develop design concepts on textiles for home fashion using user centric design
                research.<br />The
                experimental research elaborates that the luminosity of light emitted by the photoluminescent pigments
                as
                textile pigment prints depends on particle size, concentration and the texture of the fabric. The
                intensity of
                luminosity is recorded below 1lux which is comparable to natural starlight or moonlight. The
                experimental
                findings are correlated with the user perception study in the real nighttime environment, where it was
                established that the human eye can perceive the luminosity of the photoluminescent prints at intensity
                lower
                than 1 lux, lower than 5% concentration irrespective of the particle size. Similar studies were
                conducted with
                the elderly in their home setting, to study visual perception of these prints on home textiles. The user
                trials
                indicated that the photoluminescent pigment printed textiles could provide navigation aids and focus
                lighting
                for elderly care in the areas of orientation lighting, edge definition and also sleep indicators. It was
                observed that the smaller particle size (10-15 µm) of photoluminescent prints may be used for edge
                definition
                and path lighting. The larger particle size (50-60µm) due to its to longer decay profile may be used for
                the
                purpose of nightlight.<br />The study also provides valuable inputs on the design parameters that would
                be
                suitable to develop prints with clarity for use in nighttime environment. The study indicates that the
                textile
                products in home fashion may be designed that improve the light cognition not only for the elderly but
                for all
                age groups and demographics using photoluminescent pigment textiles. Thereby introducing alternate
                methods of
                light sources that promote natural nightlight so as to create a paradigm shift in the way lighting
                design is
                perceived by designers and architects.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In osteo-sarcoma (bone cancer) one of the major challenges for the surgeon is to
                resect the bone
                tumour with a margin that is oncologically safe and then reconstruct the defect gap to original
                anatomical shape
                and size necessary for proper function. It is very difficult to carry out resections in complex
                anatomical
                regions such as pelvis or joints. To ensure good alignment and fixation of patient-customized
                prosthesis, the
                bone cut must be accurate and match the geometry of such prosthesis. Proper resection and implant
                fixation can
                be achieved by using patient-customized surgical jigs, which guides the surgical tool. This work deals
                with the
                design, fabrication and application of orthopaedic surgery jigs.<br />The stating point is the CT scan
                image set
                of the patient, which are converted to a 3D CAD model using a medical modelling software. The customized
                jigs
                are designed over the 3D model of patient’s anatomy. There are however, no well-established design
                guidelines
                and standards for creating and verifying such jigs. This makes the task challenging to someone
                inexperienced in
                medicine and manufacturing. This was addressed by evolving a systematic process for patient-customized
                surgical
                jigs.<br />Depending upon the function, the customized jigs are classified as drilling jigs, osteotomy
                jigs and
                implant location jigs. For each type, essential element or module that need be provided have been
                identified.
                For example, osteotomy guide includes the surface that is conformal to bone, k-wire or other fixation,
                and the
                overhanging handle or the curved shaped beam that connects the two parts. Relevant design guidelines
                were
                developed.<br />A standard CAD model was developed for each key element. Their shape and dimensions were
                fixed
                considering the strength and ease of use. For example, the minimum thickness of the cutting guides was 5
                mm to
                take care of bending. The jig surface that is in contact with the bone was set at 3 mm. The k-wire size
                was 1.6
                mm. Special care was taken to eliminate sharp edges. The full jig is developed by incorporating these
                elements,
                making the process faster and reducing random customization that can increase manufacturing cost. The
                proposed
                methodology and design guidelines are illustrated with cases of pelvis and tibia surgery jigs, which
                were
                validated by the surgeon and proved to be beneficial.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>A growing share of the population is using mobile devices for communication, content
                snacking,
                and to an extent computing. These extremely portable devices have become almost ubiquitous. They are
                everywhere.
                A rapid rise in cross and multi-device ownership is being seen. With this advent of smartphones and
                other
                handheld devices it has become essential for us as designers to make our websites and applications
                available and
                usable to as many people as possible. We traditionally however choose to neglect people who are
                challenged from
                our primary user groups until it is an explicit requirement. This research aims to build accessibility
                design
                thinking into the UX process, guided by a model of ‘Inclusive Design’. This design research helps
                understand and
                establish the nitigrities of the environment, pain points, needs, and requirements of a challenged user.
                It aims
                to make it easier to design applications by eliminating the need to re-visit challenges by proposing a
                set of
                guidelines that can be used to improve user experience altogether. These guidelines have been
                established by
                using traditional research methods including ‘expert interviews’ with professionals, a study of
                literature, data
                analysis, interviews with challenged users, as well as usability testing along with modern-day Design
                sprint

                research
                by understanding the need for accessibility in UX design tied together with visual design will be of
                interest to

                deeply rooted
                in a particular historical and cultural context. Many children are growing up in diverse bilingual or
                multilingual contexts and learn to speak and read in more than one language. India, home to vivid and
                beautiful
                scripts in urban spaces is one of the most ideal environments to study and practice type design. There
                has been
                a rich heritage of manuscripts, calligraphy, letterpress and other aspects of letter design. The
                hand-painted
                tradition that still vibrantly lives on in many parts of the country is an institution in itself. After
                the
                advent of digital fonts however one ceases to see the same burst of freshness and variety that these
                anonymous
                hands create nationwide.<br />As designers we are aware of our surroundings, things make a lot of sense
                to us as
                we always try to find meaning out of everything that we come across. Typography is one such thing that
                we are
                surrounded with, in today's world.<br />The academic project deliberated here demonstrates how the
                scripts
                chosen from various sources. Sometimes they are taken from printed material, such as existing graffiti
                styles,
                newspapers, advertisements and labels. Indic script can be treated as art form towards unconventional
                approach
                and without conscious reasoning. Following a pattern and converting existing graffiti writing and
                incorporate
                size, color, texture and lettering aspect in an Indic script to get groundbreaking layouts.<br />The
                output of
                the research shall be a system design being an academician to foster a wholesome learning environment
                for Indic
                scripts. The conference could itself be an opportunity to discuss possibilities and encourage design
                students in
                this endeavor.<br />Conclusion:<br />Graffiti is discourse, art, and visual culture. It is a handmade,
                homemade,
                imprint upon the built environment. Graffiti is, first and foremost, ephemeral: its extreme and explicit
                temporariness is inherent in both its creation and its consumption. Graffiti brings the language of
                visual
                culture to the surfaces of built and natural environments, mediating the ways we see where we are,
                imprinting
                brick, steel, and mortar with color, script, and shade. Graffiti plays with the simultaneous gestures of
                representation and erasure, legibility and illegibility, authorship and anonymity. However, we define
                it, has
                seeped from its own domain into other realms: from the streets into the gallery, when we take graffiti
                seriously
                as teachers, we use a range of overlapping perspectives through which we and our students can engage
                with
                popular culture. India land of masses weather street or contemporary will always deliver unexpected
                fallouts.
                Working in groups, whether intra or interdisciplinary, is above all recognized for its capacity to
                unlock
                creative potential, to promote the unexpected.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The principal objective of this paper is to demonstrate the capability with creativity
                and
                innovation to develop ideas for technology driven students. The method is examined with undergraduate
                also
                graduate design and engineering students at various aspects with step-by-step progressive process. The
                paper
                describe 21st century design education as a creative method focused on innovation for society and
                industry. One
                that combines mass wisdom and talents in multidisciplinary fields through advanced digital technology. A
                virtual
                studio was proposed that contains a number of teams exploring a topic, studying it, ideating and
                designing
                innovative products. Each team is comprised of different areas of knowledge: product design, mechanical
                engineering, graphic design, architecture, art, animation and more - with students graduating first,
                second and
                third. A joint online project \"Innovation in Project Design \", using a synergistic studio method
                called
                CREATED was developed. Multidisciplinary teams (Israel, India, Australia) are challenged in projects of
                social
                importance to partners. The teaching method relates to a synchronous virtual environment, where the
                teams
                interact and learn at the same time, and also asynchronously, where they plan and respond at different
                times.
                The purpose of the joint course is to learn to work in global teams, as well as to create and design
                innovative
                products within the limitations and barriers of geography (Australia, India, Israel), different time
                zones,
                cultural and demographic backgrounds, in a team of diverse learning disciplines. (Mechanical
                Engineering,
                Industrial Design, Architecture, Animation, Visual Communication, Art, Marketing). This case study
                research,
                along recent five years, will present lot of design processes and final projects. This course challenges
                students on several levels: How to create in team framework? How to design together? Different
                professional
                field? Geographical distance, wide time zone, syllabus gap and academic schedule, gap of knowledge and
                talents.
                CREATED method follows pedagogical approach to advance innovation in design that focuses on cultivating
                creative
                thinking, among small groups of individuals with diverse skills, talents and personal/cultural

              <p>Arvind Bhallamudi (Symbiosis Institute of Technology) and Nitin Khedkar (Symbiosis Institute of
                Technology)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>abs: Glaucoma is an eye disease leading to progressive loss of vision. It can be
                detected and
                monitored by measuring the intraocular pressure (IOP). Conventional tonometers used for this purpose are
                cumbersome (require qualified ophthalmologists) and invasive (uncomfortable for the patients). In this
                work, a
                novel portable instrument for IOP measurement was developed, based on a combination of indentation and
                applanation principles. It employs a three-axis slider system mounted on headgear for accurate and rapid
                positioning of an indenter assembly over the eyelid. The assembly comprises an indenter, adjustment
                compartment
                and knob. The compartment also houses a spring, force-sensitive resistor, and printed circuit board to
                check the
                IOP after applanation. The corresponding reaction force from the eye is obtained on a force-sensing
                resistor
                using Imbert-Fick’s principle. This activates an LED signal for high levels of IOP that indicate a risk
                of
                glaucoma. The main components of the device were prototyped through 3D printing in ABS plastic. The
                device
                provides an efficient way to accurately position it over the eye for different face structures and
                varying eye
                positions among patients. It also allows sliding the instrument along a horizontal rail to conveniently
                check
                both eyes in the same setting. The proposed innovation can be used by healthcare workers to screen
                Glaucoma
                patients in rural medical camps. It can also be used at home for regular check-up by patients themselves
                and
                take suitable precautionary measures.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The design industry including design knowledge and practice is constantly evolving
                itself to
                fulfil the evolving needs of society in order to deliver a larger social impact. Social design is a
                field that
                stresses the positioning, responsibility and collective societal impact of designers and designed
                products. The
                underdeveloped and developing world can benefit largely from social design interventions. India is a
                developing
                country with social problems like poverty and poor healthcare - giving a large scope for social design
                work.
                However, major development of social design is limited to other countries. A qualitative study was
                conducted
                with 14 global design practitioners to understand the social design theory, knowledge and practice
                existing
                globally and identify directions and opportunities for the Indian context, by using a cultural lens. The
                study
                suggests creating open dialogue, simplifying vocabulary, bias-busting, fostering cross-cultural social
                design
                and encouraging mindfulness as the main opportunities. These opportunities can be applied both in social
                design
                practice and design education.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Designing products considering transportation costs and improved customer service in
                the field
                of supply chain management is termed as Design for logistics. By improving the design of the products
                for
                logistics, organizations can reduce the cost spend on transportation and delivery. Some of the important
                factors
                of adopting design for logistics are ease of transportation, ease of packaging, ease of loading
                /unloading,
                minimize transportation cost and so on. To improve the design for logistics characteristics at the
                product
                design stage, five strategies namely Flat packaging strategy, design for non-circular sub parts, modular
                design
                principles and design for ease of fabrication have been identified. Quality function deployment (QFD)
                approach,
                a successful method often used for new product development was used in the selection of strategies for
                designing
                products from a logistics viewpoint. The results of QFD shows that, flat packaging strategy and modular
                design
                principles are the critical strategies for the improvement of logistics characteristics of the product
                at the
                design stage. The novelty of this article is to establish a tool box for design experts in designing
                products
                for logistics. The methodology has been tested by means of a real case application, in an Indian

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>New ways of living require new ways of working in the offices.There is a shift in work
                culture
                towards the new needs of the company administration and management. With time it will be necessary to
                understand
                physiological, psychological, and emotional needs of the company workers. Thus, this knowledge can form
                a basis
                to develop the progressive office spaces of the future. The research focuses into employee 'burnout' and
                'mental
                fatigue' and how a cognitive break can be provided to desk job employees such that it has a positive
                effect on
                their work performance. As humans have made immense environmental developments while making their
                immediate
                surroundings more and more unnatural, it is understood that employees who are forced to work in a
                man-made
                environment experience an increase in stress levels due to a lack of exposure to nature. The research
                was
                conducted through a personal interview<br />format that covered topics related to employee aspirations,
                stress
                levels, relaxation/break time patterns, etc. The data collected was qualitative and quantitative in
                nature.
                After analyzing the data, it was inferred that employees are most relaxed by natural absions. To meet
                this need,
                i-HAWA was created. iHAWA is an interactive device to be installed in the common areas of a workspace
                with the
                intention to provide cognitive breaks to employees dealing with excessive mental activity. The aim of
                this paper
                is to introduce the concept of cognitive breaks in workspaces and present design of i-HAWA along with
                its design
                methodology, product features and functionality.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This paper incorporates a quantum design approach to design possibility through the
                lens of
                Techno-humanism (interchangeably used with transhuman) and Internet of Bodies (IoB). Functionally,
                depending on
                how the pre-sent is characterized both past and future possibilities are defined simultaneously is the
                basis of
                a quantum design approach. Please keep in mind that ‘past’, present’, and ‘future’ is utilized here in a
                literal
                sense of lived temporality. Techno-humanism is seeking to utilize and upgrade the human mind to enable
                access to
                hitherto unknown experiences and unfamiliar states of consciousness. [Harari, 2015] At the same time,
                with
                humankind incorporating a posthuman phase and largely expected to extend to a transhuman one; supporters
                of
                trans-humanism argue that we have arrived in a post-Darwinian era in which we can shape our own
                evolution [9]
                and the inevitability of a Internet of Bodies (IoB). A classic example of IoB application is the Matrix
                universe
                in the The Matrix Trilogy films. The present harbors IoB through the Internet of Things (IoT) portfolio,
                through
                its data centric lens of monitoring and optimization of networked infrastructural processes (as part of
                the
                human body) which seems as the cornerstone towards a new techno-social era.<br />The aim of the paper is
                to add
                to the crucial emerging body of ‘Internet of Bodies (IoB)’[Matwyshyn, 2019]literature in HCI design by
                leveraging a speculative design out-look to the future of urbanism in a more integrated and connected
                era.
                Additionally, through an experimental study about the future of a connected IoB future, the paper shall
                expound
                ways of enabling, creating, and presenting the probable design architecture routes to help the
                conceptualizing
                and imagining of future possibilities in a connected IoB smart city. Along-side, we will illustrate the
                results
                of the experiment through the lens of probable out-comes as a result of co-opting and co-designing the

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In India, Agriculture is one of the major contributors to the GDP (Gross Domestic
                Product), to
                the tune of 14.6% and also provides direct employment to the 55% of the population as per latest
                Economic
                surveys. While providing livelihood it is also contributing to the food security for an increasing
                population.
                However, Agriculture is also the largest consumer of water in India to the tune of 85% which is
                forecasted to
                increase by 2030. As such judicious planning for water-use is essential to maximize the water
                productivity. Many
                studies suggest that using an irrigation system with higher irrigation efficiency, like micro-irrigation
                system
                is the most direct way to address sectoral water shortage.<br />Govt. has been taking many initiatives
                like
                PMKSY (Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana) and Micro-irrigation Fund to increase the adoption of
                micro-irrigation in the country. However, in case of Assam the results have not been very positive. Data
                available from Govt. authorities reveal that the adoption rate of micro-irrigation is one of the lowest
                in case
                of Assam. In spite of Govt. giving subsidies, there are not many takers of this efficient technology of
                irrigation. As such the ground-water level in Assam is taking additional load apart from the Surface
                water
                sources owing to the smaller reach of existing irrigation facilities and lack of coordination among the
                various
                departments. Most of the studies done in the field of micro-irrigation take up the subject of crop
                productivity
                & yield and are in context to other parts of the country, i.e. excluding Assam. Considering this
                backdrop, this
                research is being done in the State of Assam for understanding the irrigation requirements of farmers
                and
                analyze the various factors involved which influence the selection of type of irrigation.<br />The
                research aims
                to understand that whether design interventions can help in facilitating adoption of micro-irrigation
                among
                farmers of the State of Assam. The objective being to develop a representative model of variables
                affecting the
                adoption of micro-irrigation system in the region and later on to validate this model using an
                experimental
                protocol, in order to help the designers in developing effective design intervention strategies. The
                research
                will also help in prioritizing factors that affect adoption decision with insights on water
                productivity.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Project planning is a critical event for overall success of a project. Project
                planning in
                business technology projects is a multidisciplinary activity and often becomes complex due to
                inter-dependency
                of various rules and process that governs each discipline individually. Many times, project planning
                overlooks
                these inter dependencies and fails to utilize the historical knowledge and best practices, resulting in
                re-work
                at later stage which leads to incurring extra time and cost.<br />To address this gap, a global
                healthcare
                company, producing medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer goods, designed and developed a “first
                of its
                kind” expert system as a technology proof of concept for flawless planning and decision support of
                technology
                projects that has serious regulatory implications.<br />This system ensures that projects \"start
                right\" by
                enforcing standard entry criteria and allows tailoring of the project plan based on project type and
                complexity.
                This technology system was designed using a rules-based decision engine and optimized search algorithm
                covering
                multiple domains like software engineering, regulations and risk management, computer system validation
                and
                project management. Design of this system aligns very closely with industry best practices such as CMMi
                and
                GAMP. This system also seamlessly interface with project management system to enable stage gate reviews
                and can
                track project outcomes in a closed loop process that reconciles projected milestones, effort, resources,
                quality
                performance (defects in the SDLC phases), cost and value between plan and actual so that the system, and
                by
                extension, the project team achieves continuous improvement.<br />This paper describes the design
                aspects of
                this technology proof of concept and results obtained from the initial pilot study which was undertaken
                to

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Ever since bounds on human rationality and cognitive biases in decision contexts have
                been
                reported, designers have exploited these weaknesses to yield conversion by creating persuasive HCI
                designs. Such
                design practices have been widely reported to be effective in influencing user decision making. However,
                the
                exploitation of a cognitive bias compromises the cognitive autonomy of an individual. This paper argues
                for the
                need of ethical assessment of persuasive design practices which undermine a user’s cognitive autonomy.
                The paper
                proposes a model for persuasive information design in human computer interaction (HCI PID model) and
                derives
                from it a framework to assess the ethics of persuasive design practices. In this framework, five design
                parameters and their twelve subcomponents have been proposed as measures of an HCI system’s
                conduciveness to
                autonomous decision making without unduly influencing a user. The paper proposes a scoring methodology
                to assess
                design features of HCI systems on the proposed parameters. The proposed assessment framework was used by
                20
                participants to evaluate five mobile applications on features that are relevant to autonomous decision
                making.
                It was observed that the proposed framework has effectively helped the assessors to identify unethically
                persuasive design features.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Innovation in minimally invasive surgical technologies can have a substantial increase
                in the
                number of surgeries performed and the patient outcome. Based on the survey done among 100 laparoscopic
                surgeons
                throughout India, the need for highly articulated surgical instruments for laparoscopy was put forth
                irrespective of the experience of the surgeon. The present innovation is directed towards an
                end-effector
                mechanism that provides the wristed motion with no singularity in roll, pitch, and yaw. To obtain the
                desired
                yaw and pitch motions, various concepts were analyzed, and the best mechanism in terms of
                manufacturability,
                innovation potential, and various design constraints was selected to be tendon driven rolling-joint
                end-effector
                mechanism.<br />In this mechanism each disc is configured to rotate in at least one degree of freedom or
                DoF
                (e.g., in pitch or yaw) with respect to each neighboring disc or end member. To control the movements of
                the
                disc elements actuation cables or tendon elements are used to manipulate the end-effector. The wrist
                mechanism
                resembles in some respects to tendon-actuated steerable members which are used in gastroscopes,
                steerable
                catheters, and similar medical instruments. Each link is in contact with the neighboring disc with a
                geared
                rolling joint profile. The discs maintain contact with each other by, for example, the tension of the
                actuation
                cables. The discs are free to separate upon release of the tension of the actuation cables.<br />One of
                the key
                design parameters in these end-effectors is the tendon placement within the joints. There are multiple
                parameter
                combinations of tendon locations, which will impact the inner channel size, the joint range, and the
                torque
                delivery. The optimization is done on MATLAB, where it optimizes the design in terms of joint angle
                range and
                tendon placement to prevent the tendons and joints from colliding during bending motion. The resulting
                optimized
                joints were manufactured using 3D printing. The end-effector will be characterized in terms of surgical
                workspace, dexterity, and manipulation forces. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) was also done for the
                chosen
                tendon driven rolling-joint end-effector mechanism.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Globally, every day about 2,92,000 women die from pregnancy and childbirth-related
                issues, which
                are mostly preventable. India accounts for approx. 20% of this maternal death, which is around 44,000
                death per
                day. More than one-third of the Indian population leaves in the rural area with low economy and low
                literacy.
                The data from UNICEF India Maternal Health also indicates that women from this low economy and education
                background account for two and a half times higher mortality rate. For these rural people, the
                Government of
                India launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005 under the Ministry of Health and Family
                Welfare.
                This mission aims to reduce maternal and child mortality through various measures and initiatives to
                control
                preventable diseases, maintain population and gender balance, provide public health service for all.
                Despite all
                this government initiative, the maternal and child health of rural India shows a mixed result. Though a
                decline
                can be seen in maternal mortality rate from the year 2007 to 2016, which is 212 death (per lakh live
                birth) to
                130 death in the respective years, this decline is way behind the Sustainable Development Goal target,
                which is
                70 death per 1,00,000 live birth. This demands a need to find an appropriate solution through design
                intervention to overcome maternal and child health awareness faced across the rural community of India.
                Information communication through Graphic Design and illustrations, often supported through television,
                cell
                phone, community awareness campaign, print media, etc. shows potential in health awareness. However,
                research on
                the effectiveness of these community awareness methods across the rural region with low literacy and
                limited
                resource has not been sufficiently explored. This research therefore, explores and investigate the
                effectiveness
                of different communication mode, along with the relation between different level of literacy and
                maternal and
                child health awareness. A case study with an aim to find key information gaps and design intervention
                needed in
                order to create awareness of safe maternal and child health practices.<br />This research is the initial
                phase
                of Design project and will outline the outcome of eight-month of field-based studies in rural region of
                Kanpur
                (Uttar Pradesh, one of the states performing worse with a high burden of maternal and child health) by
                data
                collected from contextual inquiry across 106 pregnant women, where user need, information gap, different
                communication mode, behavior, socio-culture issues, are observed, studied, analyzed and interpreted. The
                findings resulted in need of creating awareness and educating rural women on crucial health topics, the
                importance of rural health workers (Accredited Social Health Activist), and the need for design

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The paper focuses on the aesthetic assessment and evaluation of the designed product
                forms. The
                emphasis was on whether the use of narrative improved the expressive qualities and the unity of the
                designed
                artifacts. The story seems to be the condition that guarantees the unity of the object, and at the same
                time,
                gives the product form its structure by connecting and merging lines, colors, shapes, and volumes of the
                experience into a new form. This merging is what philosopher John Dewey called aesthetic experience.
                Aesthetic
                experience has a central focus, in which attention is upon its object, intensity, and unity, where unity
                is a
                matter of coherence and completeness. The results of the study confirm that using narratives at the
                conceptualization phase of the design process structured the perception and organized designers’ own
                experiences

                evaluating physical workload in the workplace, especially when they interact with workstation elements.
                Exposure
                to heavy physical work and repetitive actions are common among informal workers in handicraft work while
                interacting with non-ergonomic tools. Such working conditions, consequently, leads to the development of
                musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). In this context, a study has been conducted on handcrafted Kalash
                polishers in
                brass-metal handicraft production units located in north-east India, where most of the polishers in the
                polishing task uses a traditional polishing tool, and their working postures are mostly constrained by
                the
                design of polishing tool. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the occurrence of MSDs and the
                ergonomic risk of working postures of Kalash polishers in brass-metal handicraft production units. The

                tool, non-invasive postural acquisition using cameras, virtual prototyping, digital human modeling, and
                simulation software were used. The results of this study revealed that 100 % of polishers reported
                musculoskeletal discomfort in at least one body region during the past 12 months. The highest prevalence
                of MSDs
                was found particularly in the lower back (75 %), followed by upper back (52.5 %), elbows (50.0 %), and
                hand/wrist (47.5 %) regions. The mean severity of pain using the 5-point rating scale indicated moderate
                to high
                pain in the lower back, upper back, and shoulder regions. Further, the simulation results indicated that
                the
                adopted working postures of polishers were at a very high-risk level with the existing polishing tool.
                Based on
                these findings, implications for further research include the design/redesign of the existing polishing
                tool
                based on ergonomic principles, which may improve working postures and reduce the risk of MSDs among this
                occupational group.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>According to United Nations estimates, about 70% of the world’s population will live
                in urban
                areas by 2050. [1] Smart sustainable cities technologies and approaches, including those based on
                Information
                and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions and Internet of Things (IoT), are already helping people
                to
                overcome multiple challenges of urban development and to progress towards achieving global objectives
                for
                cities, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 11 “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe,
                resilient and sustainable”. [2] The Smart Cities Mission (SCM), launched in 2015, by the Government of
                India,
                aims at building up sustainable and inclusive cities that provide core infrastructure, a clean and
                sustainable
                environment and a decent quality of life to its citizens. The strategic components of the Mission are
                city
                improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development)
                with Smart
                Solutions applied in service delivery and governance. [3] There are several urbanisation models that
                incorporate
                digital technologies to address some of the urbanisation and sustainability challenges: Digital Cities
                feature
                the integration of digital technology into the city’s core infrastructure systems; Intelligent Cities
                rely on
                the digital city infrastructure to build intelligent buildings, transportation systems, schools,
                enterprises,
                public spaces, public services, etc. and to integrate them into intelligent urban systems; and Smart
                Cities –
                deploy intelligent urban systems at the service of socio-economic development and improving urban
                quality of
                life. [4]<br />So, here, we are trying to deal with systems of systems in physical ecosystems powered by
                various
                ICT and digital technologies.<br />Meanwhile, the existing technological approaches tend to latch onto
                the most
                hyped technology of the year and produce many silo-ed solutions for smart cities which, although
                elevates
                technology innovation, fails to engage its citizens. Therefore a design intervention is needed to help
                bridge
                this and make technologies work for humans, the citizens, the primary stakeholder. This paper is an
                inquisition
                into the role of design and designers to bring the right kind of approach when it comes to Sustainable
                Smart
                City design. The paper first lays down the high-level role and responsibilities of designers and its
                various
                other key stakeholders in crafting a smart city. Then it talks about the right kind of methodologies
                that
                designers bring at all levels of Sustainable Smart City design – from working with official bodies in
                co-creation and collaboration mode to the end-users – the citizens - to understand their wants, needs,
                and
                desires. The paper then details out a case study of a smart campus where the aforementioned methods are
                applied
                in order to come up with the most effective designs for the smart city that meet the official bodies'
                KPI
                requirements and at the same time, delivers best-in-class experiences to citizen.<br />[1] United

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we expound our theoretical hypothesis covering effective visualization
                factors in
                the area of visual analytics for a Knowledge Graph (KG) considering human cognition aspects of
                inferencing. We
                elaborate on the outcome of the research, introducing an inference variable that is established as a new
                dimension for knowledge visualization in knowledge graphs.<br />KG represents a collection of
                interlinked
                descriptions of entities – real-world objects, events, situations or abs concepts achieved by
                interconnecting
                large network of data. In the journey of data turning into knowledge, a process of rationalization takes
                place
                where - a) data is refined into information, b) schematized into correlated information and c)
                transformed into
                high-quality, conflated, schematized knowledge ready for inferencing.<br />The state-of-the-art
                visualizations
                focus on representing the knowledge graph as interconnected triples: subject, object and predicate
                (Resource
                Description Framework). However, there are evident challenges in using this for visual inferencing. The
                paper
                reflects on the first and foremost challenge with these visualizations - which is effectively harnessing
                the
                potential of a knowledge graph visually. While there is a progress on the technical front in allowing an
                inference to be queried, there is limited scope to do the same visually.<br />The second challenge
                identified is
                when the user has to use his mental space and cognitive reserve to conflate and schematize knowledge to
                infer.
                There are certain constraints with this as to how the human attention is efficiently oriented towards
                the
                relevant information and the visualized information is not cognitively loaded for the user to infer from
                it. As
                far as the visualization aspect of the knowledge graph is concerned, the aim is to reduce the cognitive
                resources used for building a new schema of the task inside long-term memory.<br />Hence, the proposed
                inferencing variable in the paper enables the release of space and conserves the cognitive reserve for
                further
                higher cognitive process of decision making. It also includes the elements of motivation for the user to
                visualize knowledge in knowledge graphs and an overview of the existing visualizations of KG.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>“Jivanam jivinãm jivaha” is a Sanskrit shlok, cited in an Ayurveda text
                “Bha-vaprakash”, which
                translates to ‘water is life to creatures’. Water, has always been an important source of life on Earth.
                However, today’s water crisis is grip-ping. In July 2019 Chennai witnessed an acute water crisis, after
                one of
                the main reservoirs completely dried up. A report by NITI AYOG pointed out that 21 major cities in India
                would
                run out water supply by 2020.<br />In response to this national water crisis, in 2019 the government of
                India
                urged its citizens to start a mass movement for water conservation and formed a dedicated ministry to
                look into
                water related affairs. The paper questions this preparedness of citizens of India to counter this
                catastrophe
                and whether their systems comply with the idea of the conservation of water that do not allow for an
                unnecessary
                water wastage. The blind installation of RO filters, in urban spaces, in the fear of consuming ‘impure’
                water,
                causes three times the amount of filtered water, to be drained off through reverse osmosis reject
                system. This
                has two grave consequences, one on the underground water reserves and the other on the human body.
                Examining
                these consequences, this paper will try to understand the fascination with RO filters and its hold over
                the
                masses. The paper will make an important intervention by raising the unasked question, are the RO
                filters
                necessary and if they do more harm than good? Finally, the paper will end with a feasible solution that
                may
                replace the damaging control that RO filters have over the masses.<br />This research started with a
                design
                perspective of re-thinking how RO water filters should be seen amidst this water crisis. Tests were
                made, for
                TDS and pH value, on samples collected from raw and municipal water sources with a brief survey to
                understand
                the psychological status of the market.</p>

              <p>Anshoo Rajvanshi (Indian Instititute of Art & Design) and Gauravi Mittal (Indian Institute of Art &
                Design)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Research has always been regarded as one of the fundamental skills in design practice
                as design
                is context driven and is a response to particular time and space. With Indian design industry coming of
                age the
                professional boundaries have now extended from design practitioners to independent researchers in
                design.
                Considering the pivotal role of research in design both in academia and industry, design research is
                emphasised
                as a strong disciplinary pillar.<br />Contemporary design education aims at a strong and holistic
                development
                oriented teaching and training for the future design professionals to which research education is
                considered
                inevitable and rather mandatory. In addition to research for context of design, curriculums offering
                degree have
                included research methodology and academic paper writing for students to learn the nuances of pure
                design
                research.<br />Research is a complex skill as it integrates procedural, involves critical thinking, time
                management and planning. However, students entering higher education mostly have false assumptions about
                their
                research abilities, as they had been successfully performing in their research based assignments in
                school,
                having all their answers directly answered by Wikipedia, Quora and Khan academy; and get intimidated and
                overwhelmed when introduced to research methodology. Theoretical approach makes research concepts abs to
                comprehend. A need was felt to develop students’ confidence in using resources, engaging with academic
                material
                and employing a range of methods for its analysis and interpretation along with ethical practices.
                Hence, active
                learning approach was adopted to teach research skills rather than research methodology to first year
                design
                students to equip them with an ability to realise the importance, relevance, and utility of their
                research
                process. More complex concepts and principles of research along with its wider implications will get
                revealed at
                advanced levels.<br />To demystify the perceived idea of research and to engage the students in the
                process, the
                teaching strategies in controlled environment are built on Bloom’s taxonomy and Vygotsky’s scaffolding
                theory
                along with motivational strategies. Student’s reliance on internet and struggles to deal with
                information
                overload is kept into consideration. It involves putting them at the centre of the learning process to
                help
                build their comprehension, analytical skills and academic writing skills at an individual level. Each
                strategy
                based on instruction, demonstration, discussion, encouragement, guided peer discussion and feedback, is
                designed
                to act as a scaffolding to facilitate learning through the guidance of the tutor and collaboration with
                peers.
                The idea is to provide individual student an opportunity to understand, comprehend, apply, reflect on
                the
                relevance of each activity or task, leading to understanding of the learnt skills with its appropriate
                application.<br />This paper maps the effectiveness of active learning strategies for teaching research
                skills,
                and identify the benefits and challenges of such approaches for both teacher and student. The data is
                collected
                from two consecutive batches of first year design students. Both qualitative and quantitate methods are
                applied
                which includes structured questionnaire and students work analysed against level descriptors. The sample
                size of
                first year design students taken is 60 across two consecutive years.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Grocery monitoring is a new trend due to people being conscious about what they buy
                and wastage
                of food. Several product design strategies have been developed to help the consumer manage groceries and
                make
                the shopping experience effortless. However, there are no service design solutions, on a system level
                that take
                advantage of these strategies. An integrated solution for grocery shopping and management will help the
                consumer
                track his purchases and food habits. In this era of online solutions, a service was developed for
                grocery
                management in the Indian context. A mobile application, which enables the user to track food habits,
                manage
                groceries and explore their needs was developed. Consumer behavior and purchase patterns were observed
                and
                studied in detail in order to understand the various needs and requirements of the user. The user
                interface,
                along with the service design and support system provides a platform for consumers to shop efficiently.
                The
                target users of this service are housewives, working women, and occasional cooks from the middle and
                higher
                middle class. The solution was designed to create a business and service opportunity for Indian

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Design education is a relatively new term as compared to human existence, but design
                is not.
                Design has been part of human civilization since its inception, and so is storytelling. It is observed
                that
                stories have an essence of relatability by evoking emotions in the listener, because of which it
                effortlessly
                remains with the user for a long time. Similarly a good design experience remains with the user for
                quite a long
                time. A story connects multiple characters, incidents with a single thread and similarly in design, we
                consider
                diverse domains like psychology, technology, marketing, art and many more fields to come up with a
                seamless
                design experience.<br />The aim of the paper is to probe the needs of design education and establish its
                strong
                connection with storytelling. Through reflection on various literature, it has been observed that
                stories can be
                used in the design process at multiple levels and in diverse forms, helping in building the requisites
                skills
                for designers. Storytelling can be a very effective and impactful medium complimenting the other tools
                and
                techniques in the design process.<br />The paper shall establish a strong case for using storytelling as
                a
                medium in design which will be useful for - design educators, students and as well as design
                professionals to
                utilize it in their respective roles and get benefitted from the practise of storytelling.</p>

              <p><b>Design, development and testing of a mechanized terrace forming equipment</b></p>
              <p>M. Angelus Khoh (IIT Guwahati) and Amarendra Kumar Das (IIT Guwahati)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Terrace fields are often seen in hilly or mountainous regions in different parts of
                the world.
                These terrace fields are man-made flat beds on hilly terrains for the purpose of farming. Slopes are cut
                to form
                flat-beds to contain soil erosion, retain water for wet cultivation, aquaculture/pisciculture, etc. With
                context
                of the North Eastern Region of India, along with terrace cultivation, Jhum/Shifting cultivation is still
                practiced in few pockets although the later has been banned in India. Therefore, there is an urgency to
                encourage the farmers of the region to adopt terrace cultivation. Majority of the existing terrace
                fields are
                formed with traditional hand tools thus, making it a labour intensive and time-consuming process.
                Mechanization
                of the process can hardly be observed even to the present day due to various reasons viz., agricultural
                machinery used in plain areas are not always suitable in hilly areas, lack of motorable roads to
                transport or
                manoeuvre such machinery and equipment, safety concerns, landholding patterns, socio-economic
                considerations,
                lack of innovative machinery or equipment suitable for hill terrains.<br />This research explores the
                areas
                where mechanization of the agricultural processes in hilly areas is required. It has been identified
                that
                terrace field forming process is one vital area. Since heavy machinery is not suitable for hilly
                terrains,
                compact power tillers are considered a more suitable alternative. However, the present power tiller
                available
                are not equipped for forming terrace fields, therefore, this paper presents the design and development
                of a
                mechanized terrace forming equipment suitable for hilly areas. Four concepts were generated and
                discussed for
                their merits and demerits and the most suitable one is chosen based on inputs from individuals familiar
                with
                design processes and a concept selection matrix to develop the prototype further. The prototype of the
                sub-units
                components developed are discussed in this paper. The paper deals with concept to prototype stage of the
                design.
                Immediate future works will focus on testing the equipment and analyzing the result(s) and making any
                design
                changes if required. Mechanizing the agricultural processes in general and terrace cultivation processes
                in the
                hilly regions of north eastern India will increase the agricultural productivity of the farmers of this
                region.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Agriculture plays a vital role in the growth of country’s economy and provides ample
                employment
                opportunities to people. Many farmers still use the traditional methods of farming which results in low
                economic
                growth. Thus, there is a need to implement modern science and technology in the agriculture sector for
                increasing both yield and profit.<br />Lack of knowledge and inability to use smartphones proves to be a
                major
                drawback for most of the farmers which is overcome with the help of this model, as this is designed to
                be
                advantageous for all the end users. The proposed system aims to reinforce a methodology in which the
                farmers are
                more connected and aware of the constant developments in the country. In this model, we develop a cross
                platform
                software that works on both mobile app/kiosk and is oriented to fulfill the needs of a farmers and
                customers.
                This allows interoperability between the phone and the kiosk system. Though there are many solutions
                available,
                most of them are not farmer friendly, to overcome this problem the system is designed with fundamental
                and
                illustrative user interface that is language independent and includes gesture-based control and voice
                assistance. Secondly, it includes smart irrigation with smart control and intelligent decision making
                based on
                accurate real time field data. Thirdly, the use of a kiosk system for the users who cannot perceive
                smartphones
                or who do not possess the same. M2M protocols is used to initiate communication between the sensors. The
                sensors
                are placed in appropriate places to fetch details like humidity, temperature, bacterial level, etc. The
                app
                encompasses a user model that supports certain features that are designed for customers which include
                buying
                products from farmers directly and omitting the interference of middleman/merchants, check their
                delivery
                status, etc. The farmers will be able to check the current market prices, analyze the demand of the
                customers
                and produce respective products, and also be able to track their orders, control irrigation, monitor the
                field
                through cameras that are installed around the field. The app also suggests suitability of seeds for the
                region
                and provides crop maintenance feature. These modules are implemented using technologies like RFID, GPS,
                etc. The
                app also is capable of detecting diseases in plants, fruits, etc. using CNN with classifiers that can
                later be
                examined by officers in government agencies like ICAR to provide knowledge regarding their issues. There
                are
                many agriculture smartphone apps on crop prices, weather conditions, inventory levels and innovative
                farming
                techniques and machinery.The data collected from the sensors is then collected onto a cloud. The model
                then uses
                predictive analysis to find patterns and suggests improvement to farmers like the amount of pesticides
                to be
                used, irrigation timings, etc. Henceforth the proposed model will help to establish a constructive and
                secure
                communication between farmers and customer. The model mounts to impact the life of farmers by providing
                a
                profitable income and sustainability. The various data that are collected can be used for further
                research
                purposes.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Indian calligraphy has a very noble, decorative, and a unique style which can be seen
                in the
                major Indian religious texts composed and handwritten by ancient Indian sages and calligraphers.
                Technological
                evolution promoted cheaper mass-produced printed copies of the same handwritten religious scriptures
                which led
                to a drastic decrease in the demand for calligraphy artists and handwritten scriptures. It has been
                observed
                that available printed scriptures have a monotonous typesetting and printing style. As a result, a
                hypothesis
                has been proposed stating that people have lost the emotional connection which they had with the
                handwritten
                scriptures. This study addresses this issue by collecting adequate data and conducting a design
                experiment, to
                explore the feasibility of offering an absolute alternative to ancient calligraphic scriptures to bring
                back
                positive psychological connections through innovative design intervention. Further, the study also tries
                to
                explore the future usage and digital implications of the experiment.</p>

              <p><b>Para, adda and residents of Kolkata: Need for design of new neighbourhoods accommodating cultural
                  legacies</b>
              </p>
              <p>Suryendu Dasgupta (Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee) and Megha Tyagi (Indian Institute of
                Technology
                Roorkee)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In Kolkata, para or informal neighbourhood refers to an urban residential unit
                demarcated not by
                administrative boundaries but by cultural and social cohesiveness of the residents identifying
                themselves with
                the particular urban unit. The colonial urban environment nurtured these neighbourhood units which
                constituted
                the domain of the ‘natives’, forming their personal urban space. With the exposure of the educated
                Bengali
                middle-class to Westernization, these paras also witnessed the genesis of significant socio-cultural
                activity of
                adda - an informal social talk, usually done in Bengali, among friends, colleagues or even family
                members.
                Conducted in public spaces within residential areas, adda is generally tied to intellectual or
                current-affairs
                topics. The social cohesiveness of the paras along with leisurely activities like adda imparts the
                quintessential cultural charm to older Kolkata neighbourhoods. Additionally, it creates a safe
                environment for
                residents with more ‘eyes on the street’ providing a sense of security on the street, even during late
                hours.<br />However, due to changing socio-politics and socio-economic conditions of the city, the
                essence of
                para and the adda culture is on the decline within new neighbourhoods. The study aims to highlight the
                need for
                extending the cultural legacies of old Kolkata neighbourhoods into new ones to address the emotional
                needs of
                its residents through neighbourhood design. The key objectives are to establish the need for extending
                the
                cultural legacy of adda to the city’s new neighbourhoods and propose interventions to encourage adda
                culture
                through urban design and policy framework within new neighbourhoods.<br />The study employed a
                comprehensive
                literature review to understand the context and interrelation between paras and adda in the colonial
                urban past
                and its relevance within the existing postcolonial, globalised urban scenario. Interviews were conducted
                with
                the residents of three neighbourhoods to gain insights from their perspectives on the need to extend the
                cultural legacy of adda in new neighbourhoods. The data was analysed using content analysis
                method.<br />The
                literature reveals that adda, as a shared heritage among the citizen, constitute three critical factors
                of
                content, time and place. It encourages social cohesion in the community and keeps public spaces active
                in the
                neighbourhood. Most new neighbourhoods experience higher crime rate owing to weak social association and
                limited
                resident’s outdoor mobility. Conversely, positive perception of residents towards street safety, sense
                of
                attachment and social cohesion was observed through interviews from old neighbourhoods with a strong
                adda
                culture.<br />Overall, the paper highlights the significance of social association in an active urban
                neighbourhood. It establishes the role of spatial design in establishing a sense of association and
                identity
                among the residents encouraging social interaction.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Tourism is one of the fastest-growing and most important economic sectors in the world
                with its
                continuously evolving trends and its potential to create millions of job opportunities. The rise of
                globalization, changing demographics, and the constantly evolving needs of people has widened the canvas
                for
                tourism. However, improved connectivity and an increase in the purchasing power of people has resulted
                in rapid
                and unplanned tourism which has proven to be an environmental challenge. With a desire to travel and
                unwind
                being the topmost priority among today's population, the number of tourists is predicted to increase by
                3.3
                percent per year causing tourism to become more of a hassle. Considering the current world scenario, the
                emerging generations (Generation Z and Millennials) are expected to contribute a significant market
                share in the
                tourism sector by the year 2040. The paper aims to identify the various pain points in the tourism
                experience
                and help advance the research and development of a sustainable tourism model. Specific attention is
                focussed on
                illustrating tourism as a part of the “Experience Economy” and demonstrating how technological
                innovations such
                as Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Internet of Things has given rise to the
                possibility of “Smart Tourism” and can contribute to help empower the host communities and at the same
                time
                enable a transparent, reliable and seamless travel experience, for the tourists.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Concepts of universal design are gradually making its roads in the design and
                development of
                public spaces (airports, shopping malls, metro-railway stations, etc.) and public utilitarian facilities
                (ATM,
                ticket vending machines, telephone booths, etc.). Although the educational institutions are an essential
                category of the public space, it is still deprived of harnessing the benefits of universal design in the
                majority of the countries. When infrastructures are created for educational in-stitutions' buildings,
                due
                considerations are given for architectural space layout, strength and stability of the architectural
                structure,
                aesthetics and functional as-pects, sustainability parameters, etc. Barrier-free environments are
                created mainly
                for wheel-chair users to make the institutional space inclusive to accommodate physically challenged/
                specially-abled stakeholders (students, teachers, supportive staffs, and visitors). Still, the
                requirements of
                different types of specially-abled people are not aptly addressed to make the built-space inclusive.
                Here, it is
                worth mentioning that the difficulties due to their various limitations among specially-abled people are
                diverse. Thus, all these necessities are to be addressed collective-ly in the infrastructure of an
                educational
                institute. Besides infrastructures, various assistive aids are crucial to facilitate quality education
                among
                specially-abled stakeholders. Through a systematic review, the current research aimed at deter-mining
                the extent
                to which the issues/ problems of the specially-abled stakehold-ers have been addressed in the design and
                development of infrastructures and as-sistive aids in educational institutes.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Current teaching and assessment techniques in the Indian education system emphasizes
                rote
                learning over meaningful learning. During teaching and assessment, more importance is given to retention
                skills.
                Moreover, repetitions of questions over the period of exams indirectly hinder the transfer of knowledge
                to
                students. This leads to a lack of inculcation of higher-level cognitive processes in children. In the
                era of the
                4th industrial revolution, new jobs demand that the workforce should have several important skills such
                as
                problem-solving, creativity, critical thinking and innovative skill. School education is the right time
                to
                impart these skills in young children who are members of the future workforce. Literature shows that
                several
                cognitive processes are at the core of these skills. These cognitive processes are also mentioned to be
                at the
                heart of the design thinking process, justifying the need for teaching design thinking process at the
                school
                education level. In the pedagogic context, the revised Bloom’s taxonomy defines 19 specific cognitive
                processes
                and classifies these into 6 major categories. With the help of this taxonomy framework, an attempt has
                been made
                to find the association between the instruction for activities within the ‘IISC design thinking’ process
                (a
                specific process that aims to optimize design thinking) and the cognitive processes. Results indicate
                that
                following the above instructions while performing IISC design thinking activities enable most of the
                cognitive
                processes recommended by Bloom, covering all his six categories. This has the potential to support the
                development of higher-level cognitive skills that are required for the 21st-century workforce.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>How can communication designers think systemically, within the context of modular
                communications, to design for social enterprises aiming to create socio-environmental impact? This
                research
                explores modular communications as a structure to empower sustainability within social enterprises; to
                create
                social impact through messaging. It contextualises the working of more with less over less with
                more.<br />By
                using a multiple case study approach, (five social enterprises mainly from India, South Africa and
                Kenya) the
                findings of which communication strategies work (education, participatory action, positive messaging,
                action-oriented engagement) and which do not, (negative messaging, blind reliance on social media, no
                social
                proof) become core themes. Interviews with the enterprises’ key leaders address the intention and
                outcome of
                their messaging.<br />Thematic analysis was used as a systematic yet flexible approach to achieve the
                core
                themes. The study also led to the creation of a diagram to visually analyse the communication
                touch-points of
                the enterprises, in modules.<br />The core themes (as foundation) and modular communication (as
                structure)
                together suggest the achievement of sustainability within social enterprises and on-going effectiveness
                of their
                communication systems. This paper can act as a guide for designers passionate about creating impactful
                communication. It sprouts conversations about processes that are required in order to achieve the
                desired
                end-product.</p>

              <p><b>Investigation of the Effect of Interactive Poster Design Using Expressive Typography that Against
                  Gender

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Typographical elements are multidimensional design components that facil-itate
                communication. A
                typographical character, whether on the printed or on the screen, is generally stable and motionless..
                With the
                currently domi-nant influence of dinamics and technology, design has taken its share from this effect
                and has
                kept pace with this context. In addiction, typography is free from static structure. Movement, as a
                consequence
                of interaction, is an innovation brought about by technology through efforts toward rapid communication,
                attraction, entertainment, and encouragement of the audi-ence. One of this project’s novelties can be
                defined by
                its use of typography to transmit messages and emotions instead of visuals. Another involves
                strengthening the
                expression of interactive posters and creating artificial in-telligence–supported awareness. As a
                result, the
                country would witness in-teractive designs via image processing. This project, which integrates design
                and
                technology, will bring a new dimension to the relevant literature. This research aims to present
                typography with
                interactive elements that promote a stationary structure. It examines the meaning of movement and
                conceptual
                structure to typography, whose expression and influence will be shown through interactive poster designs
                on
                gender inequality. Recent literature has used visuals for emotion and certain expressions. However, the
                emo-tions and situations presented by different visuals such as design illustra-tions will be provided
                by
                typography. Such interaction would attract pub-lic attention, and people will be affected by various
                typographical arrange-ments and movement.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Sri Lankan tourism industry is one of the key important sectors to develop within the
                country.
                Ella is one of the destinations which has recently become popularized with its attractive and unique
                geographical features, chilling climate and authentic local lifestyle. Homestay accommodation is playing
                a major
                role in fulfilling an excess demand for accommodation in Ella and it is contributing to the economy of
                small and
                medium entrepreneurs (SMEs). The main objective of this study is analyzing push and pull motivation
                factors of
                entrepreneurs to select homestay business in Ella. Primary data has collected from fifty homestay
                entrepreneurs
                and researcher used semi-structured questionnaire to collect data. Confirmatory factor analysis has used
                to
                analyze the data. The study revealed that to generate additional income is the primary push factor that
                is
                pushing entrepreneurship by negative external factors. Enjoyable things to do in the home-stay
                accommodation
                business can be identified as the main pull factor which is attracting entrepreneurs to homestay
                businesses.
                Apart from that this study identified some issues and challenges which entrepreneurs have to face when
                they are
                doing homestay businesses such as lack of security, lack of facilities, competition with unregistered
                homestay
                operators, lack of service orientation, difficult to maintain the standards, not enough training to
                manage
                homestays, language barriers, lack of cross-cultural understanding, lack of brand image and marketing
                activities, lack of accessibility for transportation and communication and lack of monitoring from the
                ministry
                and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). Basically this study reveals the reasons of
                entrepreneurs
                to start homestay businesses in Ella, Sri Lanka. Relevant authorized parties can be involved and
                analyses the
                challenges and issues of homestay entrepreneurs and required to give solutions for them as well.
                Finally, this
                study suggests innovative practices for homestay entrepreneurs to face identified challenges and
                problems and
                become more unique businesses in the industry.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The Bologna declaration states that, “successful learning and studying in higher
                education
                should involve students in deep learning”. However, a survey of faculty across institutes in Nepal and
                Bhutan
                highlight that the undergraduate students in engineering and management lack skills needed to be
                industry ready.
                They face difficulty in getting employed after graduation and if placed, then struggle during their
                employment
                due to insufficient practical experience, lack of good communication skills and unawareness of larger
                socio-economic contexts.<br />Undergraduate curricula across these South Asian institutes are
                predominantly
                instructional and not adequately hands-on, due to the following constraints ;<br />• University directed
                lesson
                plans that offer Educators little avenue for incorporating changes,<br />• Heavy syllabi to cover within
                that
                lesson plan and restricted time for practical activities, that constraint both Educators and
                students<br />•
                Dearth of motivation in students to innovate during the stipulated practical hours within a
                course,<br />• A
                general lack of awareness on sustainable development goals and their local implications in the
                students<br />•
                Fewer collaborations and less number of co-instructors to guide in practical, real-world issues that can
                be
                addressed in course durations.<br />The Erasmus+ funded project, “Strengthening Problem-based learning
                in South
                Asian Universities” is an endeavour to address these pressing concerns in education quality,
                employability and
                overall sustainable development of the region, and to imbibe deep learning capabilities. Problem-based
                learning
                (PBL) is a leaner-centered approach (Savery,1999) where students strive to resolve real world
                problems(Torp and
                Sage, 2002). PBL methods are reported to support the development of specific skills, such as, critical
                thinking,
                complex problem solving, self-learning, collaboration and people management, communication etc. (Duch,
                Groh and
                Allen, 2001) that are also recognised as top skills by the World Economic Forum (2016). And though
                studies have
                revealed that the ‘level of knowledge tested’, as a learning outcome, was found to be equivalent to that
                of
                traditional approaches, students who experienced PBL showed; (i) improvement in problem-solving skills (
                Albanese and Mitchell, 1993; Vernon and Blake,1993) and (ii) increased engagement and motivation to
                learn, as
                they preferred PBL to the traditional methods of teaching (Denton, Adams, Blatt, & Lorish, 2000; Torp &
                Sage,
                2002).<br />Therefore, as an empirical study to assess the above and in turn, inculcate problem-based
                learning
                in South Asian Universities, the young faculty of the inexperienced institutes from Nepal and Bhutan,
                alongside
                the students from the experienced institutes from India and Europe, were mentored by faculty and
                researchers
                from the latter to undertake several multidisciplinary case studies. The strategy of ‘Design Thinking’
                was
                employed to methodologically guide the cases and keep it consistently problem-based, i.e., the learning
                process
                is driven by the problem and there is no one correct solution (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Results showed that
                the
                participants reflected improvement in problem-solving skills and increased motivation, apart from
                enhanced
                collaboration and communication ability. Based on these findings, further development of curricula to
                imbibe PBL
                in its existing courses and guidelines to train the trainers for implementation of the same, is
                currently in
                progress.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Medical devices play a crucial role in enabling healthcare providers. In India, about
                75% of
                these devices are imported from other countries. While this ensures that we reap the benefits of their
                advancing
                technologies, these devices are expensive and do not suit the Indian market and masses. To bridge this
                gap,
                design can be a critical facilitator to translate said technologies into affordable, easy to use
                solutions,
                suitable to the unique requirements of countries like India. Consider this:<br />Tuberculosis is a
                communicable
                disease most commonly affecting the lungs of a person. According to WHO, it was one of the 10 deadliest
                diseases
                in 2018, causing about 1.5 million deaths, worldwide. To curb this disease, WHO has set 2030 as the
                deadline to
                eradicate TB completely. India, too, has set in motion an extensive plan to eradicate TB by
                2025.<br />In its
                latent form, the TB causing Mycobacterium could exist in a person without causing the disease. However,
                combined
                with any disease affecting the immune system, such as HIV, diabetes, TB could rapidly complicate the
                health
                condition and be fatal.<br />TB, in its active state, displays symptoms that could easily be mistaken
                for common
                flu, thus preventing people, especially from remote rural areas in countries of high TB burden (like
                India) from
                accessing formal healthcare facilities.<br />Additionally, most commonly used TB diagnostic tests
                require an
                elaborate laboratory set up. The accuracy of execution of these tests is highly dependent on either a
                highly
                qualified healthcare provider or sophisticated automation techniques.<br />The invention in this paper,
                called
                ‘MycoKit’, pertains to molecular analysis of sputum to deliver accurate and quick results based on the
                presence
                of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. It has been designed keeping ergonomic considerations and human error
                minimisation at its core, with intuitive interface and easy operation such that literate members from
                local
                communities itself, when equipped with a brief training, would be able to perform molecular testing
                on-site.
                Thus, community healthcare workers like ASHA, who form an important link between rural public and
                primary
                healthcare centre, can be trained to perform confirmatory TB diagnosis on-site.<br />MycoKit primarily
                consists
                of a main machine with modules for mechanical lysing of sample and PCR, and disposable Sputum Collection
                and
                Preparation container (SCP), intended to collect sputum sample and to prepare it for mechanical lysing.
                While
                the PCR machine is battery operated, a manually driven sample preparation and mechanical lysing method
                has been
                incorporated to minimize dependence on electric power and sophisticated automation, making it ideal for
                electricity scarce remote areas. The entire process is tracked and recorded, end to end, to minimize
                errors in
                reporting of test results and for database generation in remote areas. The interface also makes it easy
                for
                healthcare providers to take follow ups from potentially ill patients.<br />By smart and efficient
                design,
                sophisticated technologies, used routinely in high-end healthcare setups, can be translated to be used
                effectively at the grass root levels, thereby ensuring that diseases like TB, that go unnoticed and
                unnotified
                be diagnosed, reported and treated.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Daylighting plays a major role in the design of lecture halls. Architects and
                designers take
                advantage of daylight in lecture halls to enhance visual comfort and energy efficiency by using
                daylighting
                simulation tools. Daylight simulations provide with the ability to compare many design parameters and
                optimise
                design alternatives to promote visual comfort and energy efficiency. Still, daylight is not commonly
                combined
                with the artificial lighting in buildings as there is a lack of information and documentation on
                daylighting
                simulation tools to assess the energy-saving potential in buildings. This study aims to bridge the gap
                between
                the use of daylighting simulation tools and evaluating the energy-saving potential of daylighting in
                buildings
                by using a single objective optimisation approach. Twelve lecture halls were selected, and five
                retrofitting

                retrofitting
                strategies. Similarly, the daylight autonomy increased from 40% to 89% for lecture hall G5 and 14% to
                51% for
                lecture hall G12. The DA was found as a good performance indicator and showed a positive correlation

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The thermally comfortable environment in classrooms is significant to improve the
                performance
                and productivity of students. A substantial number of researches emphasize energy-saving potential,
                especially
                for forthcoming projects, whereas existing buildings in the world consume 40% of the energy to meet the
                desired
                indoor comfort conditions. Passive retrofitting strategies provide opportunities for reducing energy
                consumptions to achieve sustainability in the existing buildings. Presently, architects and designers
                are taking
                advantage of building simulation tools that can compare and optimize design alternatives before the
                installation. The objective of this study is to analyze the performance of twenty-two combinations of
                retrofitting solutions to optimize the thermal performance of existing classrooms in the Architecture
                Department
                located in Tiruchirappalli, India, by using a simulation-based approach. The simulation results showed
                that
                Retrofitting Strategy 1 (RS1- Expanded polystyrene + Shading device option 1+ Night ventilation) was
                performed
                better among all other strategies to achieve maximum comfort hours (three times more than the actual
                comfort
                hours). However, Retrofitting Strategy 5 (RS5- Shading device option 1 + Night ventilation) was found as
                a
                cost-effective strategy which does not include any insulating materials. Retrofitting strategies such as
                the
                insulating materials and the shading devices were effective only with night ventilation.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>English Language learners are introduced to multiple features of learning and
                storytelling tools
                that strengthen different areas of language such as vocabulary, pronunciation, etc. Development of such
                individual characteristics influences in attaining comprehension of the content in the language. We in
                this
                study probe the engagement of a learner with features provided by existing learning tools to supplement
                word
                decoding ability for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners of India. A week long experiment was
                conducted
                with three learning tools, namely, LETS Storybooks, LETS Application and Microsoft's Immersive reader.
                The focus
                of the experiment was to check for reading engagement with the learning tools and assess their features

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Problem-based learning (PBL) is defined as a “focused, experiential learning organized
                around
                the investigation and resolution of messy, real-world problems” (Torp and Sage, 2002), in which
                “students learn
                through facilitated problem solving that centers on a complex problem that does not have a single
                correct
                answer” (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). But it is important to note that PBL is not problem-solving (Savery,2006)
                alone,
                but is an “instructional (and curricular) learner-centered approach that empowers learners to conduct
                research,
                integrate theory and practice, and apply knowledge and skills to develop a viable solution to a defined
                problem”
                (Savery,1999). Barrows (1996) characterises problem-based learning environment by; (a) learning in small
                groups,
                (b) a teacher/tutor facilitating group learning, (c) the learning process is initiated by problems, and
                (d) new
                information is acquired through self-study. Savery (2006) further recommends the need of commitment of
                all
                levels of staff; research and development on the types of problems to be used; design, preparation and
                revision
                of learning resources; and appropriate assessment methods and evaluation strategies. Dolomons et.al.
                (2016)
                study, across curriculum-wide PBL implementation and single-course PBL implementation, noted similar
                findings to
                the earlier studies, where PBL has profound implications on the motivations of the student to learn,
                stating
                that “the freedom to select their (students) own resources to answer the learning issues, which gives
                them
                ownership over their learning”, and has capability to foster deep learning. In the undergraduate
                scenario for
                PBL implementation at a course-level curriculum, Caswell (2017) discusses the workflow of a module and
                identifies various roles between student or peer-teacher and teacher-educator, one of which is
                collaborating-instructor or mentor. Therefore, for continued motivation towards learning, the key
                elements of a
                successful PBL implementation are; anchoring all learning activities to a larger task or problem;
                selection of
                ill-structured, preferably inter-disciplinary problem; ownership of the problem and process, with an
                enhanced
                understanding of context; self-directed learning through engaged problem-finding and solving; and
                mentored
                learning (Savery and Duffy, 1995; Savery, 1997, 1999).<br />Therefore, to introduce PBL methods into the
                existing courses, presently taught at the participating South Asian institutes from Nepal and Bhutan,
                and
                redesign it to gain the above mentioned benefits offered by the approach, a novel strategy of conducting
                a
                design thinking workshop was engaged. In the 5-day workshop, faculty from the participating institutes,
                who are
                most well aware of the challenges, shortcomings and strengths of their curriculum, were mentored
                step-by-step,
                through the iterative process of design. Backed by the strategy of Design Thinking, the complex
                problem-solving
                activity of course design was addressed systematically, beginning with, problem identification and
                requirement
                generation; ideation and solution consolidation; evaluation, prototyping, testing; and eventually,
                selection of
                a feasible solution for implementation. As a result of the workshop, the five participating institutes
                proposed
                re-designed courses and are currently in the process of implementing the same in their respective
                institutes.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>A large number of fire-accidents occur across India every year due to appalling status
                of
                fire-safety measures and general laxity among the public. This paper explores the potential of virtual
                reality
                (VR) to educate and raise awareness amongst the masses about precautionary measures of fire-safety. The
                VR
                experience is primarily targeted for non-fire fighters. A user-centred design approach was adopted to
                identify
                various problems faced at the time of fire emergencies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and
                online
                surveys were utilized for data collection. Based on insights gained from analysing the collated data, VR
                experiences were prototyped utilizing Google Cardboard and HTC Vive. The prototypes educate the user
                about the
                use of fire-extinguishers and behaviour of smoke. As a nation-wide lockdown was declared while this
                study was
                being conducted, the user-testing could not be carried out. Hence, this paper primarily relies on the
                insights
                gained from user-research and published literatures.</p>

                education
                more chal-lenging. In the process of development, design extended into various disciplines like

                a newer vision. There has been a need for re-inventing design education. An interdisciplinary approach
                in Design
                is vital for excellence and furtherance of know-how in allied fields. To bridge the distance between the
                disciplines, we have been devel-oping a design education model at Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ). The
                paper
                will evaluate the model of design education and give rec-ommendations.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Design entrance exams are common nowadays for securing admission to Design schools in
                India, be
                it private or public institutes. Students are often examined during these competitive exams to test
                their
                creative aptitude. Over the years, format of Design entrance exams in India has gone through innumerable
                changes. In some formats, objective questions are preferred, in some subjective tests are conducted,
                while few
                prefer a combination of bothLack of a standardized format of testing creativity across Design schools in
                India,
                unlike engineering and medical colleges, raises questions like: 1) Do these Design entrance tests really
                capture
                creativity to its fullest? 2) Do they conform to any standardized format of creativity testing? The
                study
                reported in this paper intends to investigate these questions by conducting a detailed comparative study
                of
                existing entrance exam formats of Design Schools of India. A detailed analytical approach by using
                affinity
                mapping and generating open codes was used to classify and categorize question formats of different
                Indian
                Design entrance exams. The open codes were then mapped with the extracted factors of the literature
                review with
                an objective to identify the factors confirming to creativity evaluation. The results highlight that
                existing
                entrance exam, while capturing major factors for creativity evaluation, lacks in capturing a few
                essential
                factors that provide greater insight into the creative instincts of an individual assesse. A model for
                standardization of creativity assessment has also been suggested based on the study results. This study
                would
                provide new light into the nature of Design based entrance examinations in India and might lead the way
                towards
                a standardized Design entrance exam in the future.</p>

                (Department of Design, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati) and Swati Pal (Industrial Design Centre,
                Indian
                Institute of Technology Bombay)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>During recent decades, due to demand for customer-oriented product design, designers
                and
                manufacturers have been more attentive to define customer requirements during initial stage of design
                process.
                As such, importance of integrating ergonomics, particularly for capturing customer requirements, has
                become an
                essential activity. Literature provides evidence of numerous studies focusing on various design
                methodologies
                that are helpful for incorporating customer requirements at initial design stage. However, existence of
                multiple
                design methodologies makes it difficult for designers to choose one over the other. Further, ambiguity
                among
                designers while selecting any one of these me-thodologies may lead to an unnecessary increase in
                lead-time for
                product design process. Therefore, in order to address this specific issue, a comparative review study
                across
                design methodologies with an objective to integrate ergonomics requirements has been conducted and
                reported
                here. The focus of the study is on integrating ergonomics requirements in design in initial design
                stages,
                specifically to include conceptual design, embodiment design, and detailed design. This paper reports a
                critical
                analysis of the applicability of these methodologies. The outcome of the study would be beneficial for
                designers
                (with an intention to contribute towards ergonomic led innovation) to choose design methodologies
                judiciously
                and importance of customer requirements capturing at the initial stage of the design process.</p>

              <p>William Siew (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Belinda Yuen (Singapore University of
                Technology
                and Design) and Arlindo Silva (Singapore University of Technology and Design)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>In a rapidly ageing society where one in ten persons aged 60 and above is expected to
                be
                affected by dementia in Singapore by 2030 (Vaingankar, 2015), current statistics have shown that the
                effectiveness of support for persons with dementia (PWDs) and their caregivers is between average and
                below
                average (Ching, 2019). This is happening even though community networks and resources are there to
                support
                caregivers and PWDs. The local literature has shown the complexity in caring and supporting families of
                PWD,
                which encompasses a multitude of issues, from attitude and awareness to economics, living arrangement
                and
                management of care. More can be done on evaluating the effectiveness of programmes and reducing
                society’s stigma
                towards dementia (Rashith, 2019) and to alleviate caregivers’ burnout and burden of care through greater
                perceived self-efficacy and better coping strategies, support and interventions, which can in turn
                improve the
                quality of life of PWDs and their caregivers (Tay, et al., 2016). Furthermore, social support and
                network,
                including social media (Leist, 2013), can potentially reduce physical and functional decline (Unger,
                McAvay,
                Bruce, Berkman, & Seeman, 1999), and persons in locally integrated social support networks are less
                likely of
                developing dementia as compared to those in the family-dependent support network (Lau, et al., 2019).
                Since
                2018, the Agency for Integrated Care has set up eight Dementia-Friendly Communities (DFCs) island-wide,
                introduced the dementia friends/ champions, and developed a Dementia Friends mobile app to provide
                access to
                resources and help for caregivers and PWDs. Mobile technologies can provide different resources and
                strategies
                to help PWDs and their caregivers (Yousaf, 2019), but the problem lies with not knowing where are the
                cracks to
                fill in order to design a more targeted approach in meeting the needs and expectations of PWDs and their
                caregivers.<br />The purpose of this paper is to suggest the relevance of a systems approach to
                supporting the
                families of PWD and discovering the barriers to mobile-based technology-enabled information and support
                services. In particular, the current research study looks at examining the usage of the Dementia Friends
                mobile
                app and determine its effectiveness of meeting user needs and expectations for mobile-based
                technology-enabled
                information and support services in caregiving of PWD in Singapore. The study will survey and interview
                participants from households with single caregiver and households with multiple caregivers, who are both
                digitally and non-digitally resourceful, with the aim of identifying gaps and suggesting opportunities
                for
                innovation through mobile-based technologies.<br />The current study hopes to bring new findings,
                theories and
                methods in validating the current use of mobile technologies in caregiving of PWD. Future work will
                involve
                seeking like-minded individuals to join this effort in identifying the barriers that caregivers face
                when
                accessing information and support services in Singapore for future social innovations, and potentially
                carrying
                these findings over to other communities and settings worldwide.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Design thinking has been gaining importance in training and education worldwide.
                However,
                training and education in design thinking has mostly found a place in short courses and executive
                education
                initiatives. Although there is enormous value in short courses and executive education, they often lack
                the
                depth required to effectively practice the tools and methods learned. Furthermore, design is a strategic
                investment for both companies [1] and countries [2], the particular focus of this paper being
                Singapore.<br />At
                the Singapore University of Technology and Design, a new Master of Engineering (MEng) program has been
                set up to
                address this perceived gap in education. The MEng program in Innovation by Design (MIbD) is a
                research-based
                program that takes design thinking and design innovation to the level of other post graduate programs in
                other
                areas worldwide. It further develops the SUTD design ethos [3,4] toward a post-graduate level. It
                contains a
                comparatively reduced coursework load and instead focuses on research and development projects where the
                tools
                and methods delivered in the courses are actively used. The structure of the program is such that there
                are only
                three compulsory full-credit courses (green and red in Figure 1) and a significant number of electives
                (dark
                blue in Figure 1) that students can take to scaffold their research work. These are complemented by
                three
                experiences (short, no more than one-week long workshops and seminars, spread around the first year, in
                light
                blue in Figure 1).<br />The three experiences consist of<br />• the design accelerator, a three-day
                workshop to
                get all the students up to speed in terms of tools and methods of design and the 4D
                (discover-define-develop-deliver) design model;<br />• the overseas experience, an immersion week for
                co-development with students from other countries and backgrounds (done this year at the School of
                Design,
                Jiangnan University, China);<br />• and the entrepreneurship accelerator, a three-day workshop on how to
                develop
                start-ups, IP and business oriented topics.<br />The first intake of this program was in September 2019.
                A total
                of 30 students were selected (20 male and 10 female), 25 being full-time and 5 part-time. 24
                scholarships were
                given, and one student is being supported by his company. The students come from 7 countries (Singapore,
                Sri
                Lanka, India, China, Tanzania, Colombia and Indonesia) and have backgrounds in e.g. Robotics, IOT,
                Chemistry,
                Materials, Ageing/Healthcare, Drones/UAV, Food Science, Design, Sports, Mechanics, Electronics and
                Education.
                This intended diversity in background and culture enriches the learning and design process. By the end
                of the
                Master, each student will have completed a minimum of 5 full-length projects, from discover to deliver.
                Those
                taking electives may have done even more.<br />Two terms into the program, the balance is extremely
                positive.
                The program has been very well received in several presentations to companies. It is expected that these
                students will either start their own business or find jobs easily in a context that is craving for
                people with
                this formal education, a very broad view of design, and the ability to implement it.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Design is getting largely adopted by both the private and public sector due to the
                significant
                and lasting economic and social value created with its integration. As such, projects and initiatives
                that are
                design focused are increasingly being undertaken by businesses and the government in Singapore. However,
                there
                is only a nascent understanding of how the impact of design should be measured, leading to potentially
                inaccurate and/or incomplete way(s) of communicating the importance of design and the value it
                contributes. The
                objective is to develop a singular comprehensive framework to help businesses and the government in
                Singapore be
                able to measure and communicate effectively the outcomes of their design initiatives considering scale,
                timeframe, scope of impact, political, societal, cultural and environmental factors – and not limited to
                only
                financial returns. Being able to successfully and effectively communicate the outcome(s) and impact of
                design
                using this framework will allow teams, companies, businesses and the government to understand the value
                of
                design better, thus, encouraging adoption of design to a larger extent and across more industries in the
                nation.

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The Indian e-commerce industry is rapidly growing. One of the major contrib-uting
                factors
                towards the success of these companies is the quality of user ex-perience their platforms provide. The
                study
                reported in this paper primarily fo-cuses on India’s top B2C organizations and the role of definitive
                user
                experi-ence elements in shaping the success of these organizations. A heuristic based comparative study
                was
                conducted among the top e-commerce web applica-tions in order to identify unique features that
                contribute to a
                sumptuous user-experience. The analytical study was backed up by user studies that report the
                expectation of the
                customers and their frustrations. The collective insights were then correlated to each platform’s market
                ranking
                and share with an objective to identify and analyze features, design cues and elements that contribute
                to their

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Fashion is said to be monitored across the continents through cyclic trends in
                rejuvenation and
                re-establishment of innovations across the colour palette and design board. The 21st century has added
                an
                entirely new dimension to the mechanisms of garment manufacturing, the garments being manufactured as
                also the
                demand for these and newer forms of garments. There has emerged a wide gap in the world of yarns,
                fabrics and
                clothes. The expectations of the consumers have touched the zenith with their demands for bio-tolerant,
                eco-friendly and environment conducive clothes that are suitable for varying climates and varying
                situations of
                human occupation and endeavour.<br />The consumer in the current century is as conscientious of fashion
                and its
                trends as the people in the past centuries. There is, however, a tremendous gap in the functionality,
                embellishments, sourcing and sales of the creations of designers then and now. Another change that has
                taken the
                fashion world by storm is that prêt-a-portier has become as significant as haute couture with brand
                exclusivity
                being the new coinage of the fashion realm. The crème de la crème of society are increasingly following
                the
                brand band wagon as world class names like Chanel, Nike, Adidas, Pyramid and the likes are taking large
                strides
                on the fashion ramp walks across the globe. The concepts of outwear being replaced by innerwear comfort
                wear and
                casual wear are currently fast displacing the erstwhile formals. This is also true because a large part
                of the
                traditional, natural materials like silks, cotton and such like are constantly being replaced by rayons
                and
                their chemically created counterparts with spandex and lyra being the temporally recent additions. It
                has been
                observed that the 21st century stands poised to witness an unprecedented revolution in fashion and its
                manifestations right down to the grass roots level. There are numerous innovation taking place. It is
                the
                judious management of these innovations that occupies the full attention of those in the fashion
                industry spread
                cross the continents. Many of the techniques being adopted by the industry captains require intensive
                training
                and orientation to obtain optimum usefulness. There is a whole new arena of knowledge that needs to be
                percolated through the garment design and manufacturing stages. The academic institutions as also the
                garment
                manufacturing industry has to measure up to these emerging challenges.<br />There are a number of other
                developments that are sure to have a lasting impact on the fashion industry fortunes in the coming
                years. The
                promotion of micro, mini and full fledged enterprises devoted to feeding the world of creative garments
                and home
                décor is becoming visible gradually. Rural women and youth based traditional industrial occupation’s are
                being
                encouraged to diversify and feed the growing fashion industry. The focus of this paper is on examining
                the need
                for entrepreneurship and innovation management under this conceptual premise. The scope for encouraging
                enterprise through innovation management is the next learning curve for the world of garment design and
                manufacture.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Indian jewellery industry is rapidly adapting new manufacturing methods that give
                intricate
                forms with relative ease. Investment casting is one of such processes, well suited for small to medium
                sized
                objects. Jewellery surface is seldom flat, generally a small curvature is given to a shape, making it
                polish
                friendly. Many such features of form are integral to jewellery design which make them pleasant to touch,
                aesthetically appealing and visually attractive.<br />These intricacies appeal to potential clients, but
                at the
                same time details make an article difficult to finish. Interplay of surfaces creates nooks, corners and
                crevices
                between adjoining forms & features. Furthermore, it makes articulation of a target finish difficult, as
                a result
                word Finish, means different things to different people. An individual’s interpretation is also
                different and
                often leads to dissonance and painful rework. Most common, singular, remedial measure adapted in
                response to a
                demand for a better finish is more work at polish lathe. This method not necessarily improves finish,
                sometimes
                it distorts surface or makes it wavy in appearance.<br />Some parallels can be drawn from the domain of
                mechanical engineering where rather than defining surface finish, a measurable aspect such as surface
                roughness
                is an indicator of target finish. This method of measurement brings in empiricism and provides a tool to
                measure, finish through one of its pointers low surface roughness. Waviness of a surface is second
                aspect and
                that too can be methodically evaluated. The third aspect is the direction of lay, though defined, but
                rather
                subjective in a way. These can be adapted with modifications in defining target finish on an article of
                jewellery.<br />The need of time is to identify, catalogue and define various aspects of surface finish
                and put
                them in right perspective for use by industry professionals and academic institutions.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Indian jewellery manufacturing scenario is rapidly changing its working ways. As
                compared to
                traditional way of an artisan’s lodge, where few people work collectively, it has taken shape of an
                organized
                shop floor of a precision engineering division. Work is defined, articulated and results are expected
                within a
                given time frame.<br />There are different departments in a setup ranging from casting (miniature
                articles
                arranged around a central armature, called tree in common parlance) to sprue cutting and polishing.
                Though a
                person needs to be aware of whole process, one focuses and works in a small segment in these long chain
                of
                processes for achieving productivity and efficiency of time.<br />There are two sensitive areas that
                effect
                finish of a product, an article of jewellery, in a major way. These are Benchwork where components are
                put
                together assembled and semi-finished and at polish lathe. Method of giving a finish to a jewellery
                surface in
                both these areas is Mechanical Removal of material to reveal nascent metal Surface. Method is using an
                abrasive
                tool, Bonded abrasive or loosely applied fine particulate medium to achieve target finish
                parsimoniously.<br />There are merits in using abrasive processes minimally, as lesser the gold removed
                from the
                surface, lesser are operational losses. Industry, therefore, is in a need of processes that give optimal
                acceptable level of finish on surface of gold and other jewellery, with minimal operational
                losses.<br />There
                is lack of standardization, and calibration of process and different people approach target finish
                differently.
                This often leads to non-concurrence between bench workers and shop floor supervisors as well as quality
                assurance. Often leading to rework or work loss.<br />This paper is giving a structure by which a
                process best
                suited for a specific article can be designed and horizontally deployed through shop floor.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Cars were means of luxury till the late ’90s, but now they have become a com-mon need
                [1], which
                led to increase in car production. In the process of develop-ing and selling cars, form and
                functionality both
                become mature over a period of time. These comprehensive varieties of car designs have provided an
                opportunity
                for customers to choose a car to their liking at their affordance. Usually personali-ty and financial
                status
                influences the car purchase behaviour, but barely we know the effect of age on car selection. Literature
                highlights a significant number of studies that have focused on evaluation of car form, that
                specifically
                investigated it’s perception among a target group. However, there have been very few studies that
                focused on the
                role of age and its effect on perceived attractiveness of a car. The study reported in this paper
                presents an
                ethnographic investigation along with a small experiment to identify and observe the role of age in
                influencing
                per-ceived car attractiveness. A total of 166 persons who own a car and are from the age group of 18-60
                years
                have been interviewed in the study. A detailed qualita-tive report was generated from the interviews and
                it was
                analysed to draw in-sights. Results acquired from both the qualitative and quantitative studies
                high-lights that
                age affects the perceived attractiveness of cars. Further, design cues were extracted to develop a
                prescriptive
                framework suggesting motifs that influ-ence a particular age group. The study results would be
                particularly
                helpful for automotive designers as they can correlate design motifs and cues with particular age
                groups, and
                thus it would support them in taking informed design decisions to optimise the design process.</p>

                maximum
                adoption and longer loyalty. All this has led to an<br />increased emphasis on user engagement. Often
                the

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>User Centered Design (UCD) process is a comprehensive and widely accepted methodology
                practiced
                by designers across numerous areas of specializations like product design, user experience design,
                interaction
                design, web design etc. The central philosophy of this approach is to empathize with the user at various
                design
                decisions in order to fulfil user requirements. Like UCD approach, the Stanford Biodesign process is
                also an
                accepted and widely used framework specifically for health technology innovation. UCD philosophy and the
                Stanford Biodesign process both lay strong emphasis on deep understanding of user(s) and stakeholders as
                their
                basis for focused ideation and development. However, health technology innovation brings additional
                challenges
                and constraints in its course of design and development, which not only require to satisfy user
                requirements but
                also clinical and demographic requirements for successful healthcare implementation. This paper
                discloses such
                challenges of health technology design and development and synthesize the requirements that needs to be
                considered in a design methodology. Later, based on these requirements the paper compared both Stanford
                Biodesign process and UCD process in terms of methodological effectiveness for highly sensitive
                healthcare
                innovation. The paper also highlights issues where UCD approach fails to address some of the
                requirements for
                healthcare innovation and suggests additional contexts and stages to be considered by a UCD practitioner
                as an
                easy adaptation for healthcare design projects.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>India is a country well known for its skill and handmade. As per the research data,
                despite
                having a rich heritage of traditional manufacturing skills, India's share in the international market
                for craft
                is less than 2%, while that of China stands at 30%. According to the United Nations, over the past three
                decades, the number of Indian artisans has decreased by 30%. These alarming numbers indicate the need to
                reinvest in artisans, to safeguard our history, culture, traditional knowledge, and an important source
                of
                livelihood. The pressing problem faced by the Indian craft sector today is to create an ecosystem that
                benefits
                all stakeholders in the value chain and help to sustain the craft and the craftsperson. Apart from the
                above-mentioned issue, there are various other challenges like availability of raw material, issue of
                mass
                production and time, availability of correct market value, etc. Hence there is an urgent need that we,
                as
                designers, understand these issues and try to create a favorable environment for the craft to sustain.
                This
                paper is an attempt to identify these issues related to the survival of a craft, by taking a case study
                of the
                dying art of traditional wooden toy craft & Ganjifa cards of Sawantwadi in the Konkan region of
                Maharashtra.

              <p>Ganesh Kailas (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur) and Nachiketa Tiwari (Indian Institute of

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The incredible growth of eXtended Reality (XR) applications will be leading us to a
                world beyond
                our imaginations in the coming decades. Extended Reality is an umbrella term that encompasses different
                categories of immersive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality
                (MR).
                From the traditional applications like entertainment and training, XR has been spreading its wings into
                a large
                number of applications in healthcare, aerospace, product design and prototyping, e-commerce, workspace
                productivity, architecture and building industries. Immersibility of the virtual reality scene into the
                physical
                world will be crucial for its acceptance by mainstream industries and future development. In addition to
                the
                virtual scene's visual perception, spatial audio is a key feature in designing truly immersive XR.
                Hearing is
                the fastest sense of humans, which makes virtual auditory display (VAD) an ineluctable part of any XR
                application. In this work, the importance of three-dimensional spatial audio in XR applications is
                explored in
                the user perspective approach. User experience (UX) is improved to a large extent when the applications
                make use
                of spatial audio compared to directionless hearing experience. Spatial sound has a crucial role in
                giving
                information regarding actions in the background and beyond the field of view (FOV), and thus in making
                proper
                three-dimensional realism. However, designing user-dependent virtual audio reality is challenging
                because of its
                parametric dependence on human anthropometric features. This work also suggests the possibilities of
                utilizing
                computer-aided designing (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools in producing personalized

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Innovation in design is positively influenced by the selection of successful con-cepts
                from the
                multiple, varied alternatives generated. Prior research explicated that, Design Heuristics are the
                prompts,
                which allows novice designers to gener-ate a number of alternatives and avoid design fixation. However,
                available Design Heuristics are Industrial and Product Design specific. There are no heuristics
                available
                specific to Furniture Design. This paper presents the systematic devel-opment of Design Heuristics for
                Furniture
                Design (DHfFD), a concept genera-tion tool for novice furniture designers. The tool has been developed
                from an
                analysis of the characteristics of 650 award-winning furniture (chair) designs and published compendium
                of
                well-known, successful designs. This paper extends the research on the impact of DHfFD use by
                investigating the
                effectiveness of the tool through a pilot study. Initial testing has been done successfully with design
                students
                in the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati and has been enthusiastically adopted by students to create
                concepts
                that are more diverse. This study correlates DHfFD with more number of alternative concepts in furniture
                design.
                This re-search integrates evidence, methods, and perspectives from cognition and design correspondingly
                provide
                a pedagogical recommendation to use Design Heuristics for Furniture Design to overcome the issues in
                innovation
                in furniture design with the novice designers.</p>

                Dehradun, India)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Anatomy is the science that studies the structure of the body. The human body is
                composed of
                many different types of cells that together create tissues and<br />subsequently organ systems. It
                consists of a
                number of biological systems that carry out specific functions necessary for everyday
                living.<br />Typically,
                school students start learning about Human Anatomy starting from<br />standard VI (i.e. between ages 10
                - 15
                years) and gain a basic idea about all of the important organs and their functions. However, a quick
                survey
                reveals that students find it difficult to visualize how human organs look from inside and outside. They
                also
                lack an understanding of the basic functions of these organs. Further, as most of the instructional
                medium is
                based on a two-dimensional static paper-based medium, it lacks the look and feels of actual
                organs.<br />To
                tackle this problem Augmented Reality (AR) technology was utilized. AR is an interactive experience of a
                real-world environment that is enhanced by<br />computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes
                across
                multiple sensory<br />modalities. AR is an easy and feasible solution through which we can see
                and<br />understand objects which cannot be seen in the real-world.<br />The proposed interactive AR
                application
                helps students learn about Human Anatomy in details. It allows them to see different organs and their
                inner
                structures in the real-world environment through different perspectives and understand their
                functioning.
                Initial testing was conducted among N = 10 users between the ages of 10 - 15 years. Usability concerns,
                willingness to continue usage of AR application and learning outcome were tested. Preliminary results
                indicate a
                positive influence of the participants towards adopting the proposed AR solution.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>An estimated 50,000 people in India need a heart transplant annually. Today, one of
                the biggest
                challenges is practical: moving organs from one hospital to an-other. LifeBox is a device that addresses
                this
                problem with a system that extends preservation time of the heart, specifically to allow for increased
                travel
                time and distances. It utilizes non-recirculating, intermittent perfusion of non-oxygenated,
                cardioplegic
                solution in hypothermic conditions. Preservation conditions of the donor heart directly affect heart
                health and
                patient survival. Consequently, the design of the device presents a unique set of risks that must be
                adequately
                identi-fied and addressed. This work presents a case study, using LifeBox, that captures the adopted
                risk
                management approach. Emphasis has been laid on the pathway to derive requirements that attempt to manage
                the
                identified risks. The authors hope that this study will serve as a practical guide for designers,
                practitioners,
                and innovators in the medical device industry.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The importance of learning theories is that they expose the learner to a wide spectrum
                of ideas,
                thereby expanding the knowledge base while allowing the learners to experiment, analyze and internalize
                their
                observations. It allows the reader or the learner to assume different theoretical positions and analyze
                the
                theory.<br />Ideally theory classes enrich design studios because they serve as labs where theories are
                tested.
                They are not concerned with the time frame that is required to arrive at a product. Therefore they take
                away the
                burden from design studios in terms of experimenting with ideas and various concepts. In all the study
                of
                design, the principles, factors and elements that comprise, modify and establish design can be summed
                into three
                categories. There are factors that physically comprise design, factors of ephemeral and intangible
                quality that
                modify design, and authoritative elements that root design at a particular place in
                time.<br />Unravelling the
                process of design begins with the physical elements. They have been understood as points, lines, planes
                and
                volumes or mass. These elements are composed within a field at a macro or micro level through an array
                of
                spatial organisations using principles of design such as balance, proportion, hierarchy, etc. Their
                scope is
                largely aesthetic. There is a layer of other elements that to a large degree affect the cognition and
                visual
                perception of the user experiencing a space or object that is superimposed over the tangible layer of
                physical
                elements. These elements may be referred to as ‘Modifying Elements’. The physical elements are rooted
                within the
                framework of relevant modifying elements to include factors such as cultural, anthropological and
                metaphysical.
                Authoritative elements are the third layer of required super imposition while designing because they
                firmly root
                and add soundness to the design, stemming from the essence in theories derived from the past. It is
                these
                authoritative elements that will be explored in this paper. Together the study of physical, modifying
                and
                authoritative elements give a holistic idea to one embarking in the endeavor of design.<br />In most
                cases of
                theoretical analysis there is a sense of looking backwards - to the study of established facts and the
                principles that may be gleaned from it. The authoritative elements are specifically that. The word
                authority has
                its base in the word author which means someone who has the power to bring something into existence and
                sustain
                it. In other words, with respect to design, it is these elements that bring richness to design or add
                the
                dimension of depth, so to say. The authoritative elements are history, typology, progress, tradition and
                design
                habits. They discuss how design is influenced and established through precedence set in facts from the
                past. The
                impact of Authoritative Elements on design will be explored and ascertained in this paper. The
                methodology of
                inquiry and research is through survey questionnaire and exercises in the design studio.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Improved mileage and reduced emissions are one of the key challenges that industries
                are looking
                forward to overcome. One of the promising strategies identified for this is the weight reduction of the
                structural components. Owing to these requirements, the recent decades have seen a tremendous increase
                in the
                use of fiber-reinforced polymers as candidate materials for structural applications; their high specific
                strength (strength per unit weight) and specific stiffness (stiffness per unit weight) have made them a
                desirable material for designers. Further, fiber-reinforced composites offer the advantage of tailor
                suiting the
                properties which results in optimization of parameters. In the present work, a typical seat base of a
                scooter is
                selected as the potential component for weight reduction through replacement of existing material –
                viz.,
                polypropylene with advanced composite materials. A systematic approach has been followed in the process
                which
                has led to successful design and development of the fiber reinforced seat base for
                two-wheelers.<br />Synthetic
                fibers, such as Glass fiber and Carbon fiber have established themselves as a potential choice for high
                strength
                applications. However, these fibers are expensive and non-biodegradable. With growing
                environment-consciousness,
                researchers have explored various natural fibers, which have the potential to be used in applications
                where the
                components are subjected to lower level of stresses.However, taking into consideration the other aspects
                such as
                environmental degradation, one could look for the hybridization of natural fiberswith available
                synthetic
                fibers. Design data relating to hybrid composites is scarce in the literature. In view of this, as part
                of this
                study, mechanical property characterization of the hybrid natural fiber composites was done.<br />Stress
                analysis is one of the major activities as part of the product design. In the present study, a Finite
                element
                model of the part is created and the various properties obtained from the material property
                characterization
                study areused as inputs for material properties. Non-interactive failure criterion is used to find the
                failure
                stress of the material and the design parameter (thickness) is finalized. Based on the results of the
                Finite
                Element analysis and the design for manufacturing aspects the CAD model of the product is
                iterated.<br />To
                verify the proof of the concept – viz., seat base with polymer composites, prototyping of the seat base
                was
                carried out incorporating the design for manufacture principles relating to polymer composite materials.
                In view
                of the limited volume, hand lay-up technique was chosen and the prototype tool developed for the
                prototype. A
                test method is used to evaluate the part characteristics with respect to the existing material with a
                targeted
                weight reduction of 30%. The prototype was checked for repeatability, stiffness and fit on the existing
                scooter
                and was found to be meeting the requirements. A weight saving of close to 40% was achieved through the
                use of
                hybrid polymer composite material.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Designing frugal innovations is crucial to alleviate problems faced by people living
                in low
                resource settings. Many design studies have been undertaken in such low resource settings. These studies
                are
                discussed using a variety of names such as ‘frugal innovations’, ‘appropriate technology’, ‘design for
                the Base

                development’, etc.
                There is an important need to know in what context these studies were undertaken. In order to gain an
                in-depth
                understanding of the contextual aspects of these studies, we review a wide range of literature, focusing
                on
                design studies in this field. The review findings show a multifaceted picture, revealing a large variety
                in

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>This article presents a design approach in improving driving comfort, a key feature,
                particularly for passenger vehicle, focused on conventional type, being the largest category and is
                growing
                steadily to a big future market with high customer demand. There are several aspects to driving comfort,
                one of
                which is concerning the effort or driver’s involvement required in gear-shifting action. The aim of this
                work
                has been to achieve the design objective, which is, enhancing comfort by lessening driver’s involvement
                to
                provide greater ease and is realized through a two-stage methodology; first, to devise an expedient
                gear-shifting strategy and then to reconfigure or fashion the transmission gearbox with a compatible
                multi-clutch layout by modifying the architecture of the existing dual-clutch based one, to enable
                implementation of the proposed shifting strategy through it. A new shifting strategy, based on merging
                of speed
                ratio ranges, as conceived here, is brought about by rearranging the connection of gear trains of the
                existing
                reference model and hence, the term merge is used to underscore the strategy. Merge gear-shifting
                strategy is
                purposed to address the start-and-stop as well as frequent shifting needs in driving, while retaining
                engine
                torque and rpm, gear ratios and vehicle speed as that of existing reference model as common basis, from
                which
                the new multi-clutch architecture is reconfigured. Functional requirement, imposed by the Merge shifting
                strategy, needs compliance of certain constraints; one such is mounting of designated gear members on a
                particular shaft, and the other, torque carrying capacity, provide information on input and controlling
                parameters respectively, for design planning. Modifications or redesigning of the architectural layouts
                of the
                gearbox are based on reverse engineering approach, as it adopts the scheme of tracing back and built
                from the
                reference dual-clutch model. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of possible alternative designs,
                modeled as
                stick diagrams, depicting power-flow through the gearbox members, are generated and then only those
                complying
                the shifting strategy requirements, upheld as feasible, are screened out based on a couple of criteria,
                namely,
                gear mount arrangement and torque transfer consideration. Both the proposed gearbox architecture and the
                reference model are computationally tested using standard HWFET driving cycle to ascertain the number of
                shifting instances and it reflects that the former needs nearly sixty percent less effort to drive,
                providing
                improved driving comfort. Therefore, the new design exhibits a sound prospect in the category’s market
                segment.

              <p><b>Effects of Persona Stereotyping on Design Solutions: Observations from an empirical study with
                  novice
                  designers</b></p>
              <p>Abhishek Dahiya (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi) and Jyoti Kumar (Indian Institute of Technology
                Delhi)
              </p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Persona is widely used in the design industry as a tool to understand and empathize
                with the
                users. Personas are intended to help designers by providing them useful user information and more
                importantly
                helping them remove the personal bias towards their users. However, without proper training and
                education, the
                information given in the persona could be misleading resulting in designers not appreciating the
                benefits of the
                tool. Such behavior could not only fail the actual purpose of creating a persona but can also be
                misleading to
                designers while taking crucial design decisions. With the increase in the number of young designers
                joining
                design academics and industry in India, it becomes important to investigate the design behavior of
                novice
                designers while working with such tools in the design process. This paper presents observations from an
                empirical study done with 80 novice designers. The study aimed to investigate how user information
                presented in
                the form of a persona affects the conceptual design solutions produced by a novice designer.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The posture of a virtual character contributes to animation when a dramatic story is
                being
                produced. This research uses the Big Five model, the BFI-44 question-naire, in order for participants to
                evaluate the personality of seven virtual character postures. The stimuli postures were inspired by the
                BEAST
                experiment and were intended to detect emotions based on overall body language. The results show that
                whole body
                posture affects a participant’s view of the personality of the virtual character. There were significant
                differences found among postures in terms of openness, extroversion, and neuroticism traits but this was
                not the
                case for postures suggesting conscientiousness and agreeableness traits.</p>

              <p>Christy Vivek Gogu (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi) and Jyoti Kumar (IIT Delhi)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>The global pandemic has affected almost every aspect of life across the globe
                including medical
                services, essential services, production units and educational institutes. People have been forced to
                physically
                and socially isolate themselves. This study focuses on the sudden shift that design schools in India had
                to make
                from traditional face to face (F2F) classes to starting virtual classrooms online. This paper reports
                results
                from semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with ten design instructors from ten different
                design
                schools across India. The authors attempt to understand how the design instructors compared the online
                classes
                with traditional F2F classes, and how they perceived the effects of instructor-student connectedness and
                interaction on teaching motivation and satisfaction in online design teaching. This study found that
                most
                instructors felt a lack of social connectedness with the students during the online classes. The paper
                discusses
                details of some of the reasons for this lack of felt connectedness and how it affects the teacher
                satisfaction
                and motivation in online design education. In addition, it reports the insights given by the instructors
                about
                some of the creative learning practices in design courses that they are currently finding challenging to
                replicate online.</p>

              <p><b>Conceptual Design of a Robot for Cleaning Narrow Spaces</b></p>
              <p>Apala Chakrabarti (VIT University, Vellore)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Markets for both cleaning services and cleaning robots are growing fast, globally as
                well as in
                Asia. Markets in emerging economies are, however, highly cost-sensitive where most cleaning is currently
                carried
                out manually. Cleaning robots reported in literature as well as available commercially focus primarily
                on
                cleaning of wide surfaces; access to and cleaning of narrow spaces are not adequately addressed.
                Further, the
                cost of current robots is at least twice that of the competition. Using the IISC Design Thinking
                Approach, this
                paper focuses on developing near term solutions to these problems: affordable surface cleaning robots
                for narrow
                spaces for Indian middle-class domestic markets. The paper proposes conceptual solutions for three such
                robots
                all of which meet these criteria. It then compares these with one another using three criteria, area
                cleaning
                efficiency, time efficiency, and cost, to select the most promising solution. The work is meant to not
                only
                propose novel and potentially affordable and useful solutions for a long standing, unaddressed problem,
                but also
                provide a demonstration of the power of a structured design process, and design methods such as
                requirement
                analysis, brainstorming, morphological chart, and weighted objectives method, in developing such
                solutions.</p>

              <p><b>Requirements Capture and Validation: Adopting the Lean Approach for Task Clarification</b></p>
              <p>Komal Shah (Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore) and Manish Arora (Indian Institute of Science,
                Bangalore)</p>
              <p><b>Abstract: </b>Requirements capture is an important activity in the development of any product, as it
                contributes to the understanding of the problem, and the solution of any problem can only be as sound as
                the
                understanding that it is based on. The consequences of poorly captured requirements can be significant,
                leading
                to wasted resources and missed market opportunities. These issues can be addressed by using a
                market-oriented
                method for systematically validating the captured requirements, making informed decisions about their
                alignment
                with the market opportunity, and consequently, refining the requirements, before they are used in the
                subsequent
                stages of product development. This paper outlines a lean-based approach to task clarification stage of
                engineering design process, for capture, validation and refinement of requirements. The approach is
                further
                demonstrated by its application to design of a urinary incontinence care device. The proposed approach
                will be
                valuable to design engineers for efficiently capturing, validating, and refining requirements for new
                product
                development.<br /></p>
